            ‘Don’t you fucking do it, Eddie!’ I said as the countdown initiated. I saw
            he was going to do it. I decided to change tack and smiled, splaying my
            hands in a gesture of placation. ‘Surely we can talk about this?’
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing on the correct side of the escape pod hatch, Captain Eddie didn’t
            smile. I knew I probably should have listened to the lizard. ‘Don’t go into
            the escape pod; Eddie’s going to blow you out of the hatch,’ Bob the Lizard
            had said, but how was I to decipher such cryptic warnings?
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the captain reach up towards an unseen button. I pursed my lips with
            mild concern. Well, shit, I thought as the alacritous cannibal engaged the
            release mechanism. My infinitely witty and cutting scathe was interrupted
            ferociously as I was ejected from The Trestle. I smacked my head into the
            pod’s porthole and lost consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might have noticed that I skipped some of my story; well, tough, because
            I’m not going to recap the whole thing, as I may be free of this cell soon.
            You have the gist of the tale though, I’m sure; I’m Adam Ash, the galaxy’s
            greatest, humblest space detective, yada yada, so on, so forth. I’m sure you
            remember all the mishaps and miscreants I’ve encountered thus far; Majestic
            Rex the murderously effusive robot, Seabiscuit the singing corpse frog, and
            now Captain Eddie and his mission to taste the flesh of every species in the
            galaxy. Remember? No? Well, sometimes I feel people just don’t want to
            listen to my riveting stories. What? You don’t want to listen to my story?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, anyway, I was shooting through the cold void of the Outer Boundaries
            in that spinning tumble drier for God knows how long as I intermittently
            regained and lost my
        </p>
        <p>
            senses. Eventually, the escape pod’s tumultuous spinning eased, and I no
            longer had to battle consciousness shooting out of my nose and mouth and
            ears like leaking jet fuel. After the dizziness subsided, I pressed my face
            to the porthole, certain that there was some way out of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s quite beautiful up there, you know, beyond the exosphere. Have you ever
            been? Even before I left Earth, it always fascinated me, that unending
            visage of coal-dark oil and its thousand-eyed stare. It’s why I was so
            excited to leave Earth, and Titan, I suppose. Things have a way of falling
            short of expectations; hell, you certainly fell short of my expectations.
            But the first time I skirted the Pillars of Creation on a battered
            plasma-skip or felt a warp engine rattle and rearrange my very atoms,
            there’s nothing that can compare. So many things to see in this little home
            cluster of ours, isn’t there? Things to do, people to meet and befriend and
            …
        </p>
        <p>
            Sorry, where was I? Ah, yes, the tomshittery with Captain Eddie!
        </p>
        <p>
            I fucked up; I knew that Captain Eddie had been up to something terrible,
            but I hadn’t known that the captain knew that I knew he was up to something
            terrible, you know? Though my plans went awry, at least this way my greatest
            fear had been averted; being eaten alive.1 My musings on cannibalism were
            interrupted by flashing amber and the beeping that I had become far too
            familiar with in the past year. An incongruently calm voice said, ‘Planetary
            collision imminent,’ and here I am on your strange planet!
        </p>
        <p>
            When I emerged from the pod, I was ill at ease – the jungles here, the
            birds, the bees, those asshole cicadas, it was all unnervingly similar to
            Earth’s biome. I’d been lucky not to
        </p>
        <p>
            teeter over the plateau where the pod had crashed, but it did give me a
            glorious view of the land, rolling hills like the carved scapula of a dead
            giant covered in follicles of tree ferns.2
        </p>
        <p>
            There seems to be a highly strange confluence throughout the galaxy wherein
            planets seem to be possessed of a singularly ridiculous theme; Moribund is
            Gothic, Auboroboro is Blade Runner, and Planet Rat has all those gorillas.
            Your planet is no different. From that lovely plateau I could see some
            buildings in the valley below. So, with the pluck of adventure feathering my
            cap, or rather my cowboy hat in this case, I set on my way. It wasn’t long
            before I came across the park.
        </p>
        <p>
            It had seen better days. The thoroughfare was littered with the carcasses of
            palm trees and the fallen straw gables of concrete edifices. Half of the
            streetlamps had collapsed before the plethora of arcades and gift shops,
            barring any easy passage, and the rollercoaster track that circumvented the
            park had fallen near the visitor centre, terminating like an unfinished
            thought.3 The architecture itself was odd; it seemed to be of familiar human
            design, consisting of concrete and white limestone, but built on a far
            larger scale than anything I’d ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought it best to set up camp and search for any signs of life in the
            morning; I took up short residence in one of the gift shops, this one titled
            Holocene Holiday Shopping. It was a sad looking thing with its shattered
            windows and half-collapsed roof. It didn’t offer much protection from the
            elements, but it provided more shelter than its fallen brethren strewn about
            the place.
        </p>
        <p>
            I entered and perused the shop’s displays, and my confusion grew. On the
            shelves were battalions of stuffed toys crafted to resemble naked men and
            women of all hues, their
        </p>
        <p>
            heads and hands and feet portrayed in bulbous, cartoonish proportions. Then
            there were the lunchboxes, with more naked men and women depicted on them,
            many of them running through tropical fields and lazing beside crystalline
            waterfalls. What sort of resort I had happened upon? I was reminded of the
            slave colonies of the Outer Boundaries, where malignant aliens would
            establish hunting compounds populated with intelligent species from
            conquered worlds to be released and killed and eaten; had I landed on one of
            these hunting complexes?4 Disconcerted but resolute as ever that I would not
            be murdered and devoured by aliens, I went to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            I awoke to a strange, earthen smell, like the robust odour of a dirty
            stable. In the grey morning gloom, I saw a man standing outside of the gift
            shop. Rather, I saw his torso; he was stupendously tall, his head hidden
            from sight. Glad to see another human, I rushed to speak with him, hoping to
            learn where the heck I was.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, it turns out he wasn’t human, not fully anyway. He was a skittish
            fellow; I exited the shop and there was the clip clopping of hooves echoing
            on asphalt as he tore off. It took me a moment to realise that he was not,
            in fact, a horse rider; he was the horse. I’d never seen a centaur before.
            Hell, I didn’t know they were real. I noticed that the horseman had written
            a message before the gift shop, the letters sloping and elegant: BEWARE THE
            LIZARDS. Perturbed that the alien centaur knew English, I continued my
            journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the distance there seemed to be a radio tower, its warning lights
            blinking sluggishly as dusk dusked once again. Off I went in the hopes of
            sending an SOS.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was struggling valiantly through a thicket when I heard voices. Crouching
            low and moving with painstaking care, I moved through the brush, grimacing
            as the ferns about me rustled. As the voices grew louder, I paused and
            noticed a set of footprints in the dirt, three-toed tracks that seemed to
            terminate in stubby little claws. I crept closer to the chittering
            conversation. I had just reached the edge of the thicket when the voices
            became intelligible. Hidden, I listened.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘We need to find that fucking monstrosity before it kills anymore of our
            researchers,’ one of the voices whined, a strange huffing between each
            breath. ‘Dr Wong is furious that the park has been out of commission as long
            as it has!’ I grimaced; this was not the first time I’d been called a
            monster, and I didn’t even remember killing any researchers since I’d
            arrived, though it was quite possible that I’d Dorothy’d someone when I
            landed.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Calm down, Clemens,’ said another voice, softer but still accentuated by
            the strange huffing. ‘Once we re-establish power to the towers and the
            surveillance stations it will be a matter of simplicity to find it. Don’t
            worry your little bald head.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Hmph, I don’t know, Jackie,’ Clemens said. ‘Dr Wong said if we can’t
            capture it by the end of the month the investors will pull out of the
            project. Jesus Christ, the investors don’t even know about the deaths in the
            park yet!’ I frowned. Jesus Christ? Had the Christian fleets already thrust
            this far into the Boundaries? I sidled closer to get a better look at the
            suspiciously human-sounding aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Clemens, really, you’re going to make me pull out my—wait, did you hear
            that?’ I froze. There came a guttural snorting such as that of a frightened
            horse shying from a rattling rattlesnake. ‘Whoever’s out there, we’re armed!
            You’d better show yourself or we’ll … we’ll …’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Jackie, I can see him! I can see his cowboy hat!’ Clemens said excitedly. I
            heard the distinct racking of a shotgun.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Show yourself!’
        </p>
        <p>
            I hissed a quiet curse but didn’t budge. ‘I’ll shoot!’ Jackie said, and her
            voice sounded much closer, though I still couldn’t see her through the
            brush.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Wait! Wait, don’t shoot!’ I called. A hero always knows when to surrender.
            ‘I’m coming out!’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘You’d better!’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Jackie, it’s not the—’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Shut up, Clemens!’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Before I give myself up,’ I said, ‘I need assurance that you’re not going
            to eat me.’
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a pause. A disconcertingly long pause.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Why the fuck would we eat you?’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I dunno,’ I mumbled, suddenly shy. ‘Lots of people have tried to eat me
            before.’ Why wouldn’t they want to eat me? There’s no doubt in my mind that
            I’m delicious.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘We’re not going to eat you, dumbass. Now get out of those bushes, this is
            private property.’
        </p>
        <p>
            I removed myself from the brush, hands raised, eyes closed lest I saw the
            muzzle flash of doom. When I stepped to, there was a prolonged silence, and
            I thought maybe I’d scared them away. Expecting more centaurs, I opened my
            eyes and beheld an oddity.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the foot of the radio tower stood two dinosaurs in lab coats.
            Specifically, they were two pachycephalosaurs, the rondure of their skulls
            sheening in the sunlight. One held a clipboard in its stubby little hands,
            its mottled tail of forest green swishing nervously behind it as I stood
            there, dumbfounded. The other, its beady eyes wide with surprise, held a
            teeny tiny shotgun that was now levelled at my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tension snapped.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘What the fuck?’ we three said in unison.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘A talking dinosaur!’ I said delightedly, for I truly loved dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘A talking human!’ the clipboard-wielding pachy said in alarm.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘This is … well, this is just swell,’ I said, a tear of joy coming to my
            eye.5 I took another step forward to hug these corporeal childhood dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Clemens, steal his fucking blood!’ the dinosaur with the shotgun squealed
            as it raised its armament skyward and blasted buckshot into the air.
        </p>
        <p>
            I flinched as the other pachy threw his clipboard to the ground and charged
            at me, his head levelled, his body transmuted into a keratinous battering
            ram. The little fucker was quicker than he had any right to be, and before I
            knew it, I was thrust back into the thicket. There was a great deal of
            thrashing and punching and kicking as we struggled. I lay prostrate as he
            repeatedly headbutted me.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Mercy!’ I yielded heroically, and to my surprise the pachy stopped ramming
            his bowling ball head into my gut.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Jackie, should I kill him? It’d be easier to steal his blood if I killed
            him.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘But we can steal more blood if we keep him alive. Hold on.’
        </p>
        <p>
            A radio brrrped nearby. ‘Dr Wong, this is Jackie. We’ve made an unusual
            discovery …’ Her voice faded into obscurity as I tried to clutch everything
            that hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some time passed, I’m not sure how much, when Jackie’s voice loomed in my
            ear. ‘Dr Wong wants to see you, human. Welcome to Holocene Park.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘So, here I am,’ Adam said. He sat in an eggshell blue cell enclosed by
            spotless steel bars, his tattered cowboy hat beside him on the bench. His
            other hand was slipped through the bars and, in a tendon-ripping death grip,
            clutched the rough-skinned arm of a petite microceratops. The tiny,
            blue-hued dinosaur lay on the ground, its crest-shaped head shaking as it
            struggled through fatigue. A trolley bearing water bottles stood beside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘It’s been … it’s been eighteen hours,’ the micro said. ‘I just asked if you
            wanted water, and you gave me … you gave me your whole life story.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Oh, my bad,’ Adam said and released the microceratops. He frowned as the
            micro tried to climb to its feet, wavered, then collapsed. ‘You should
            probably drink some water or eat or something,’ Adam said, shaking his head.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I can see God,’ the micro said as its eyes fluttered shut and lay its head
            upon the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nearby a door shnkked open. Adam stood as the fluorescent lights were
            eclipsed and a shadow enveloped him. He looked up, saw the dim outline of
            rippling musculature under an ill-fitting lab coat, tiny, forked arms, the
            curvature of a crushing jaw, two amber eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Wowzers,’ Adam said as the tyrant lizard looked down on him. ‘Dr Wong, I
            assume?’
        </p>
        <p>
            The tyrannosaur grunted, and there was the scrabbling of small claws along
            the waxed floors. Adam looked downward as a tiny green dinosaur, no longer
            than his forearm, darted between the T-rex’s legs. This dinosaur also wore a
            lab coat, and a pair of bucket glasses.

            ‘Hubert, please see that Phillips is given some water and rest,’ the little
            dinosaur said. The T-rex nodded and stooped, delicately picking the
            microceratops up with its jaws. The colossus ambled away through a large
            door, its footsteps resonating in Adam’s chest cavity.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Just like in the movie,’ Adam said, smiling as he pointed at the T-rex.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Assuredly,’ the procompsognathus said. ‘I’m Dr Wong.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I’m Adam Ash,’ said Adam Ash, studying the doctor. ‘I’ve a lot of
            questions.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Wong waved a hand impatiently. ‘I listened as you put Phillips into a coma.
            The long and short of it is that two distant solar systems bore congruent
            biological life cycles, one human, one dinosaur. It seems that our histories
            are nearly identical, except for the fact that your species made a film
            about cloning dinosaurs.’ He pushed his glasses up his snout with a slender
            claw and clutched the clipboard tight to his chest. ‘I, however, will make
            cloning humans a reality.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Adam nodded. ‘Okay, so you’re going to clone me? I had a clone before, I’d
            always wanted one, but it didn’t end well; I kept forgetting to feed the
            dumb fucker. I’m sure my spawn will be safe with you. Can I go now?’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I’m afraid not,’ Wong said, hopping up and down. Adam couldn’t tell if it
            was out of excitement or frustration or if it was just a weird dinosaur
            thing. ‘You see, we’ve had a problem with the genome sequencing of extinct
            humans as we could never find a complete
        </p>
        <p>
            strand of human DNA; bones calcify and the genetic material leeches away,
            gone forever. So, we had to use—'
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Donkey DNA,’ Adam said, thinking of the centaur.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Horse DNA,’ Wong snapped. ‘We had to use mammalian DNA to complete the
            mammalian sequence, it’s the only thing that made sense. We were successful
            only once, and it birthed a monstrous crossbreed. We call him Bobby
            Horselegs; he has the intellectual capacity of a super genius and the
            horsepower of approximately one-half horse. We couldn’t restrain him, and
            this is my shame to bear. He’s been killing off my staff one by one – even
            Hubert can’t find the goddamned aberration and kill him.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Adam sniffled glumly, knowing that the little dinosaur was going to force
            him to find the half-human, half-horse monster.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I want you to find the half-human, half-horse monster, Adam Ash,’ Wong said
            gravely. ‘I want you to save my life’s work – Holocene Park cannot fail.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I’m, uh, not good at finding monsters.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘You said it yourself – Majestic Rex the murderous robot, Seabiscuit the
            corpse frog. You’ll do a sterling job.’ Hubert re-entered the room as Wong
            spoke. The T-rex glared at Adam as Wong unlocked the cell door. ‘Off you go
            now,’ Wong said. ‘Work as if you’re life depended on it!’
        </p>
        <p>
            I fucking hate dinosaurs, Adam thought as Hubert escorted him out of the
            jail.
