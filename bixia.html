            'Bìxià.’
        </p>
        <p>
            The word crawled out of George’s mouth, a limp thing that had dragged itself
            up his larynx only to die in the torpid air of the Indian Ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            George Thomas Staunton, twelve-years old and with the complexion of old
            whale fat, clutched the gunwale of the Lion as it rocked back and forth in
            the prodding waters. This mild churning of the ocean waters was nothing
            compared to the storm they had endured off the island of Tristan da Cunha;
            in the spring of 1793, three months earlier, the current had gripped the
            anchored belly of the Lion and wrenched it out to sea. There had been deaths
            that night in the south Atlantic.
        </p>
        <p>
            George felt nauseous.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I do not understand this word that you say,’ Mr Li said, not unkindly. They
            stood by the ship’s foremast. The Chinese man leaned easily against the
            taffrail despite the ship’s lurching. ‘It is not bicks-ia, Master Staunton;
            it’s bees-zya.’
        </p>
        <p>
            George hung his head, dejected.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Fret not, George,’ Mr Li said. ‘Despite what Padre Cho says, you are doing
            well.’
        </p>
        <p>
            George looked up and scanned the British ship of the line. Two hundred
            sailors scuttled across the top deck, their humours ill as they weaved
            around the hundred or so attachés of the Macartney Mission. Valets and
            scholars and painters and watchmakers and diplomats milled near the jeer
            capstan, watching as a flock of lesser frigatebirds, their gullets as red as
            strange sunsets, floated alongside the Lion. George saw Padre Cho stalking
            along the poop deck below. Cho, through some diabolic cognisance, seemed to
            sense George’s gaze; he jerked his head and looked up to the foremast,
            locking eyes with George.
        </p>
        <p>
            George looked away and swallowed hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I would daresay that I have been stilted in my progress in learning your
            native tongue,’ George said. ‘Perhaps Padre Cho is correct in his
            estimations. Perhaps this is not a worthwhile pursuit.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘You are cruel to yourself,’ Li said. ‘For one so young your growing mastery
            of Chinese has been rapid. I have no doubt that you will please Emperor
            Qianlong.’ Li looked over George’s shoulder and bowed quickly. ‘Lord
            Macartney. Sir Staunton.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord Macartney and Sir George Leonard Staunton had climbed to the foredeck
            where Li had been conducting his impromptu lesson. Lord Macartney smiled at
            Li and dismissed him with a silent wave of the hand. Li bowed and left. Sir
            Staunton clapped a hand onto George’s shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘How go the lessons, George?’ Lord Macartney said. To George, Macartney
            looked as regal as the King of England himself; his wig was prim and
            powdered despite the humidity, the frills of his neck ruff crisp as they
            protruded over his scarlet sash, his stature tall and proud. George
            understood why the king had sent Macartney, an eloquent and sophisticated
            and thoughtful man, to broach Emperor Qianlong of China.
        </p>
        <p>
            King George had set Macartney a crucial task; meet with Qianlong, and
            establish British trade routes throughout inland China, so that the British
            Empire could imbibe the victuals of tea and silk, that it may grow hale and
            content with these eastern delights. George had no doubt that Macartney
            would succeed in this task.
        </p>
        <p>
            He did, however, doubt himself. He had been learning the language and
            characters of the Chinese for eight months; it was the hope of Macartney
            that a British speaker might impress Qianlong. To George, it seemed an
            impossible goal. Though Li was patient and
        </p>
        <p>
            agreeable in the conduction of his lessons, Padre Cho was less so; he would
            often remind George how inept he was at speaking the language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite his misery, George persevered.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘George, come with me,’ his father said. ‘Dinwiddie tells me that Saturn
            will appear tonight, and he has established his contraptions on the
            quarterdeck that we may see it.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometime later, after the sun had set, George made his way beneath deck.
            Snores drifted through the air, soft and guttural and punctuated by the
            creaking of the keeling ship. As he passed the stairs of the servant’s
            quarters, he stopped. He heard Cho and Li speaking in their native tongue
            beneath. Though he knew he shouldn’t eavesdrop, he stood at the top of the
            stairs and listened.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘…fool’s errand. Staunton and his lord are idiots; they will not get what
            they want …’ It was Cho speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘There is no harm in …’ Li said. ‘… what difference is it to us that they …
            and Young George may please the emperor. He is trying very hard.’ George
            felt tears gathering. They were talking about him and his ineptitude. He
            fled from the stairs and the stinging words and retreated to his quarters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The emperor’s men met them at Tianjin and escorted them up the White River,
            the ribbed hulls of the imperial junks gliding through the water like
            lacquered water striders. From Tianjin they travelled to Tongzhou. There,
            the emperor had sent the British an abundance of provisions – they were
            given an assortment of bulls, caged pigs and chickens, rice, watermelons,
            dried peaches, and pumpkins – for their arduous journey overland to Beijing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon reaching Beijing, George, as well as an irascible Macartney, was
            surprised to find that the emperor was not present. Qianlong had withdrawn
            to his palatial retreat in the north to escape the oppressive summer heat
            that enveloped the capital. His mood as thunderous as the storms that had
            accosted them in the Atlantic, Macartney and his entourage left Beijing and
            began the last leg of their journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            They arrived at the emperor’s northern palace a week later. Lord Macartney
            and his entourage were astounded by the elegance and vastness of Qianlong’s
            court and its inhabitants. However, on the eve of the Macartney meeting with
            the Qing emperor, amazement turned to fury.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘He wants me to what?’ Macartney said to the interpreter. Macartney’s
            entourage was assembled in a courtyard that echoed with the gurgling of
            myriad fountains. Qianlong’s topmost advisor, a man named Heshen, spoke
            rapidly to the interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘It is necessary that you perform the kowtow upon greeting the emperor,’ the
            interpreter said. ‘This is non-negotiable.’
        </p>
        <p>
            The kowtow. An abject display of servility to Qianlong that all tributaries
            were obligated to perform. It comprised of kneeling before the emperor on
            two knees and bowing nine times, bowing so low as to touch the ground with
            one’s head. Macartney, utterly apoplectic, disagreed with Heshen; performing
            the kowtow was most certainly negotiable.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I will offer Emperor Qianlong the same deference that I would demonstrate
            to King George,’ Macartney said. ‘I will do no more. I will not be treated
            like the common chaff of these Asiatic vassals under Qianlong’s rule; I am a
            representative of the Empire of Great Britain and will be treated as such.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Heshen, expressionless, listened to the interpreter. He then left without a
            farewell. A heavy silence infected Macartney’s followers, and George felt
            smothered by it. They had
        </p>
        <p>
            travelled for almost a year to reach this fabled land, a strange and
            fantastic expanse that had been shrouded from British eyes until now, a
            shroud they had penetrated to witness the majesty of the Qing Empire. To
            have it undone so close to the mark, to fail the charge set upon them by
            King George, filled George with a ceaseless dread.
        </p>
        <p>
            They needn’t have feared. They were summoned to Qianlong the next morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            George felt wonder and bile rise in his throat as he followed Macartney’s
            procession into the imperial court. Qianlong sat on a raised dais, his
            advisors standing at attention beneath him. Despite the wondrous
            craftsmanship of the court’s awnings and wooden pillars and the emperor’s
            seat, despite the magnanimity of Qianlong’s vassals in their silken and
            rainbowed robes, George could not help but feel the crushing weight of
            terror.
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew Cho had been right, that he pursued a fool’s errand. He knew he
            would fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            He half-listened as the imperial interpreter spoke for Macartney and
            Qianlong. The interpreter’s tone seemed muted, hostile. George could not
            force himself look upon the dais where the emperor sat.
        </p>
        <p>
            George kept his head low as the introductions began. He glanced up to see
            Macartney performing a bastardised bow to Qianlong. His father stood beside
            him, his hands clasped behind his back, his head bowed in deference. George
            wanted to grasp his father’s hands, wanted to beg him that they return to
            the Lion and make the journey home. Instead, he stared at his feet and
            listened to the pounding of his pulse in his ears as the interpreter spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘George.’
        </p>
        <p>
            He snapped his head up. His father was looking down at him; George started
            as he realised that the whole court was looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘George,’ his father said again, softly, ‘Emperor Qianlong asks if there are
            any Englishmen present who can speak Chinese.’
        </p>
        <p>
            George blinked and did not move until his father gently prodded him forward.
            He held his head low, bowed in respect as he approached Qianlong’s dais. He
            could feel the emperor’s gaze upon him, a Sisyphean weight that threatened
            to crush him into nebulous nothing. George stopped before the emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Bìxià,’ George said, performing an English curtsey. Your Majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Welcome to my court, young master.’
        </p>
        <p>
            The voice was soft and kind and strange. George raised his head on a
            wobbling neck. Qianlong’s face was long and narrow, and his eyes belied no
            emotion that George could discern. The Qing emperor, expressionless, reached
            behind his back and produced a small purse of maroon silk. He held it out
            before him, proffering it to George.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Take it,’ Qianlong said. ‘It is a gift for you.’
        </p>
        <p>
            George timidly took the purse, his hands clasped over it as if it were a
            small bird about to take flight. In Chinese, he said, ‘Thank you, Emperor
            Qianlong. It is a beautiful gift.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Emperor Qianlong then surprised George; he smiled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elation. Pride. Triumph. That is what George felt upon seeing Qianlong’s
            smile, the smallest curling of the corners of his mouth. ‘It is my pleasure
            to receive you in this court,’ Qianlong said. ‘You may return to your
            countrymen.’
        </p>
        <p>
            George bowed. He turned and saw his father and Lord Macartney and all the
            assembled plenipotentiaries of the mission beaming at him. It was upon their
            emanating admiration that George floated down from the emperor’s dais, as
            light as a feather as the victory of the moment filled him, the weight of
            his venture dissipating like dew in the morning sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            His joy burned in his heart for the remainder of their audience with
            Qianlong, and he could feel that it had infected his countrymen. They left
            the emperor’s retreat the next day,
        </p>
        <p>
            their moods jovial as they journeyed to Beijing and Tongzhou and Tianjin and
            Canton and the Indian Ocean, assured of the fact that they had instigated
            favourable relations with the Qing, certain that the emperor had been taken
            away by the young English boy who had spoken in Chinese so eloquently and
            respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Britons travelled home, their humours were unmarred by the reality of
            their failure, for there was no way they could have known that they had
            failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Qianlong would not expand trade with Britain. The imperial palace writhed
            with fury and indignity at the refusal of Lord Macartney to perform the
            kowtow. The Britons, due to their arrogance and dishonour, could not be
            allowed to thrust into mainland China, as their alien ways would bring
            nothing but toil for the dynasty of the Qing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Macartney’s mission had been a fool’s errand, an exercise that had
            demonstrated how little the British Empire understood the vast and ancient
            kingdom that ruled the lands to the east of their known world.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, little would George know that Qianlong would often and fondly
            remember the English boy, a stranger from a strange land of which he himself
            understood little, who had spoken so humbly to him in the heart of his
            empire.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fool’s errand had not been George Staunton’s.
