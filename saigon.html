            He took his usual seat at the front of the diner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, for the third week in a row, there were no other patrons in Mme
            Gauche’s. He did not need to wonder why. It was 4am, and though there was no
            official curfew, none who valued their lives would wander the streets of
            Fauborg Marigny once the sun had set. Most wouldn’t anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Night Officer Arnaud Berthier lay his newspaper flat on the counter’s
            surface and lit a cigarette. A cup of black coffee, steaming, was already
            waiting for him. He glanced at the mug, looked up to see where she was; he
            could hear her in the back, making a racket. He noticed that there was a
            tattered book on the counter, at the far end of the diner. He tilted his
            head and read the spine. The Inkspots played quietly from a radio by the
            cooker. The music suffused with the aroma of grease and coffee and tobacco.
            There was also the pungent scent of garlic, as a dozen cloves hung from the
            ceiling behind the counter. He breathed in deeply and bathed in the smells
            and the sounds and found reprieve. It had been a long night.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had just started reading the newspaper when she came in. He tore his eyes
            away from the headline: ‘2nd AUGUST 1963 - NIGHT POLICE REINSTATED IN
            LOUISIANA AS INFESTATION TAKES HOLD’. He glanced back at the paper and
            pretended to read it as she went about refilling the coffee pots, though
            there was no one else to serve. He clenched his jaw; he could feel a blush
            seeping into his cheeks like he was some damned schoolboy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Inkspots faded away to soft crackling as the signal was interrupted. He
            watched out the corner of his eye as she tutted. He heard her smack the
            radio. His eyes were pinned to the newspaper, a muddle of characters and
            monochrome photos that he couldn’t discern right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Piece of shit!’
        </p>
        <p>
            He glanced up, hoping perhaps that she was talking to him. No, just the
            radio. Why would you want her to call you a piece of shit anyway, you piece
            of shit? He shook his head and took a swig from the coffee. Two sugars.
            She’d remembered. Again. He inhaled as if to speak, and thought better of
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            She walked behind the counter and he shifted in his seat, his head low over
            the newspaper. She hummed softly to herself as she went about her business.
            He thought maybe it was Chopin that she was humming. Say something. What’s
            the worst that could happen? She thinks you’re a fucking idiot and you find
            some other hole to wait in until you’re redeployed to New York. Elvis
            replaced the Inkspots. He couldn’t stand Elvis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thud. He looked up, the half-cindered cigarette dangling from his mouth. He
            leaned over the counter to see what had fallen; a clove of garlic rolled on
            the turquoise vinyl floor. She sighed and stooped to pick it up. He blanched
            as she stood, as he hadn’t the time to look away. She met his gaze.

            Arnaud, when he had fought in Vietnam, had once seen a cargo barge capsize
            in the bay of Saigon. The captain had lost control of the rudder and ran
            straight into the concrete
