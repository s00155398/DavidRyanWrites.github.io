        <p>
            I never really liked sport, so when a man with a basketball for a head was
            elected as president, I was pretty nonplussed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Before my accident in the fall of 1988, I had been a freelance journalist
            for the Chicago Chew. It was a two-bit gutter-pulp hack factory, a twitching
            corpse that bled hot ink and cheap newsprint two streets down from the
            Tribune. It wasn’t an establishment that concerned itself with the Red Wave
            in Europe and Asia or the cocaine epidemic pouring in from Colombia. It was
            a celebrity tabloid, a greasy morsel for the God-fearing people of America,
            devoid of grandiosity or fear of impending nuclear annihilation.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I was good at my job. I had a knack for spotting the celebs that were going
            to crack and burst like a cheap bulb, the ones that had done one too many
            coke binges or assaulted the maid or fucked someone they shouldn’t have
            fucked. A lot of the bigger papers would snatch up my stories, but there
            were plenty of other bottom feeders with degrees from Urbana-Champaign
            sifting through the filth of Chicago in the summer of ’88 eating up the
            game. It was around then that I decided to change tack, so I bought some
            decent recording equipment and a cheap video recorder.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Then, ringing the bells of Gomorrah, I summoned those that I would turn to
            salt so they could repent.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It was slow at first, but eventually a steady stream of celebs came to me
            and my recording booth out in Bannockburn to tell their side of the story.
            They’d come and disparage and deny and equivocate their misdeeds, misdeeds
            that had been revealed to the public by me and mine. I’d sit and listen and
            be kind and patient and I’d draw the tears out like a beaked bloodletter,
            recording it all in glorious Technicolor. I’d shake their hands, cut the
            footage, send it off, and suck up both sides of the buck. Well, it seemed
            people liked it; the public were quick to forgive, as all it took was a
            single tear rolling down a cheek on the glossy face of a Videocon to sway
            opinion on these fallen gods.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I knew the public didn’t really care. It was a window of escape, an escape
            from the pavements cemented with shell casings and broken needles, an escape
            from the graffiti on the walls that had been sprayed in blood, an escape
            from the crushing plutocratical hand that had wrung the vigour from its
            people, an escape from the bleakness of reality, an escape to the
            trivialities of those veneered gods whose troubles and lives did not matter.
            In this I found succour; I offered the ticket to the booth with the roving
            shadow lamp, shadows on the wall of a carnival tent that made the people
            smile and forget. Their misery was my nourishment, their need to escape my
            ambrosia.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            What I hadn’t expected, when I distributed my banal interviews with our
            modern idols, was that the public also liked me. They liked the inoffensive,
            sympathetic mannequin conducting these interviews, and soon I became as
            popular as those that I vindicated, if not more so. I was the mould into
            which the masses could sink, the plastic sheen of my eyes and my smile
            theirs and theirs alone, each and every one of them.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            After a certain interview in which I secured clemency for a basketballer who
            shall not be named, a well-beloved and voracious individual with voracious
            appetites, I rocketed into the stratosphere of fame.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Before long, a broadcaster, one of the big ones, offered me an evening slot
            on their schedule to conduct my interviews. I accepted, and in no time at
            all I was suckling from the teat of human shame and rage in quantities that
            could not be measured.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I subsisted on this, the Edmonds’ Show, for all of four weeks before I was
            hit by a car and sent flying into a coma.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            To me, there was no passage of time at all, but a great deal changed during
            my absence.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I awoke to find that my body had betrayed me. There were no mirrors, but
            with hands that had become dry, and liver spotted, I could feel my face, a
            face that was gaunt and drawn and unfamiliar to me. A man stood beside me.
            He had the markings of a basketball tattooed to his shaved head. He gave me
            a handful of flashcards.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            'You read. You ask,’ he said. He refused to answer any questions I had and
            left me. I pored over the nigh illiterate questions on the flashcards.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘mr b tel wheye u r gud presdint.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘mr b wheye r ppl frade?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘mr b wheye r ppl run?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Those were the only three questions. Disturbed, I managed to climb out of
            bed and hobbled to the window to see what had become of Chicago.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Astro plains of arid courts, red as the sands of Riyadh, red as blood, as
            green as deep faerie forests, stretched to the horizon. Drooping steel
            gallows with plate glass faces winked at me like the thousand faces of a
            diamond in the setting sun. The droning of construction drills corkscrewing
            into the bosom of the earth rattled the hospital window. Nothing of Chicago
            remained, no stone corpse nor iron skeleton to tell of the great city that
            once sat here.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and Despair! That’s all I could think as I
            looked upon the endless scores of basketball courts that had subsumed the
            might of Chicago. At least Ozymandias had had a pair of stone legs remain to
            mark his passage in the desert.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            They came for me soon after and took me away.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As we sped through Chicago in a rusted to shit Cherokee XJ, I saw the people
            of the city. I was too old and frail now to find them anything more than
            curious; they sweated and panted in the basketball courts, droves of the
            young and old and fat and skinny and lame and hale and pregnant and invalid,
            all laughing and cheering as they chased one another. Some were sluggish as
            they played in the heat of that summer day; others lay prostrate on the
            searing artificial grass, and they did not move. They were all bald and wore
            the same basketball markings on their heads.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Our destination was a lone court where a man sat on a collapsible steel
            chair. There was an empty seat across from him. A couple of TV cameras and
            their operators loitered on the peripheries. I was deposited into the seat
            across from the strange man.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘You read. You ask,’ a voice whispered in my ear. I wasn’t paying any
            attention to this as I was preoccupied by Mr B’s appearance as he sat across
            from me.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            He wore a suit the colour of lapis lazuli, and scuffed Air Jordans. His
            appearance would have been pedestrian in Chicago, if it had not been for the
            literal basketball he had for a head. I thought at first maybe it was a
            mask, but I could see that the butyl rubber of his crown flowed and melded
            seamlessly into his neck. Sometime thereafter, when I cradled the last
            vestiges of sanity to my heart, I would surmise that Mr B’s miraculous,
            hellish birth had come in the aftermath of the 1989 Chicago Bulls victory
            over the Cavaliers. Not that it matters.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘You read. You ask Mr B,’ the voice said again, punctuated this time by a
            sharp poke in the back of my neck. I complied.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The air rattled through my old throat as I spoke. ‘Mr B, please tell why you
            are a good president.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            When Mr B spoke, his voice was as sterile as molten plastic.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Dribble,’ he said. I looked back to my escort, and they nodded.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Mr B,’ I said, struggling with a hoof-thumping giggle in my larynx, ‘why
            are people afraid?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Shoot.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Mr B, why are people running?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Pass.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Prompted by those who had brought me here, I asked Mr B the same three
            questions over and over again; his answers did not change. This seemed to
            please those gathered in the court. As the sun sank into the west and I
            repeated the interview, something strange happened. Mr B’s demeanour didn’t
            change – he didn’t fidget or shift in his seat or turn his head – but, for
            whatever reason, I didn’t feel surprised when I began to understand his
            responses.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Mr B, why are you a good president?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Dribble. I am a good president, Mr Edmonds, as the people love me. I am the
            idol with which they worship the vitality of life. I am the hope that fills
            their hearts, the petrichor that fills their nostrils after the storm has
            passed. Under my care, they have become united, singular in their wants and
            their needs and their happiness. Without me, their lives would be nothing
            but brief and directionless sojourns in a nightmare realm. I am a good
            president, Mr Edmonds, as I have given the people purpose and hope.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Mr B, why are people afraid?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Shoot. Only those who misunderstand the order that has come are afraid.
            They fear that if they choose to play golf or football or hockey rather than
            the One True Sport, then they will be taken beyond the courts and disposed
            of. This is not true; this does not happen. Under my government, all sports
            are welcome and encouraged, though it cannot be said that they are as
            important as basketball. On the West Coast there are numerous summer camps
            where those who do not wish to play the One True Sport can enjoy their
            chosen game to their hearts’ content, until they see the light. They need
            only step forward and make themselves known, and we shall accommodate them.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Mr B, why are people running?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Pass. They run because they are afraid of change, but there has been no
            change if they would take a minute to stop and see. Though the physical
            state of the world has shifted, nothing else has. With the opiate of
            television and fame, a new Church was formed wherein we injected our veins
            with worship of the material, worshiped those whose teachings provided
            neither wisdom nor peace, but merely offered divine distraction during this
            brief interlude of the game. I am the God of this Church, a Church that has
            come to these lands that does not promise what cannot be promised. It
            provides an earthly heaven for those who are faithful in their devotion to
            me, for those who would open their hearts to me, for those who would be
            content.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘I alone am the only God to have walked this hallowed Earth, and all should
            acquiesce, and find peace and happiness in my arms.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Why me?’ I asked, drained. I felt I was in the thrust of a terrible
            nightmare, the last visions of a dying man who had looked upon his past
            deeds and found himself wanting. ‘Why bring me here to ask these questions?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Mr B cocked his head, a gesture of curiosity.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘There was no one else that I could have asked to light the way for those
            who run, Mr Edmonds. After all these decades, your name has not been
            weathered by the sands of time, for you are the prophet of our time, the
            herald of the devotion to the material plane, the wielder of the Eye of the
            Fly into which I, the Divine Icon, speak.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Look upon me, the living icon for the peoples of the world to divest their
            faith and answer their dreams and wants.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Look upon me and see the sum of your deeds, Mr Edmonds, the incarnate
            proselytization of a corporeal God courted to these lands by your hand.
