            Battle of Hannipt
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Day 301
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Lying quietly amongst dead leaves and dead men, William DeLat listened to
            the shattering of a dying world.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            They never reached Fort Lunonen. Still on the western banks of the Demerero
            River and less than a day from their destination, they had received the
            word; the Calmodians were advancing.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The order from General Kerghast, safe in his quarters on an offshore
            destroyer, had swept through the ranks; the men of the Tenth Division,
            joined by remnants of the Fourth Army, were to reconnoitre with a contingent
            of the Royal Syspirron Cavalry and occupy the territory west of the
            Demerero. They were to stop Cal from taking the river crossing to the fort.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Sunlit gloom and the onslaught of muggy air diffused through the rainforest.
            The col trees about him shivered tremulously as artillery roared in the
            distance, though the towering guns were many miles away.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Leaves fell gracefully through the air, alighting on William. He didn’t
            brush them off, for fear that his movements would be seen. Gunfire popped
            incessantly in the distance, like torrential rain smacking a tin roof in
            great droves. William couldn’t hear the screams, but he knew they were
            there, drowned out by the barrages. His sweaty hands slipped on his rifle, a
            filthy ’18 Lantus Bolter. Careful now, the safety is off, he thought to
            himself, wiping his right hand on his dark brown uniform. A frightfully
            potent mix of fear and humidity filled the air.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A Gildaynean Remora zipped overheard, its sleek hull glinting through the
            canopy, its propellers whining as it disappeared.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William lay in the well of a looming col tree, its roots splayed out like
            great webbed toes. His rifle rested on a cleft in the bark; he had a clear
            line of sight of the glade ahead. The edge of the glade was only about seven
            hundred feet before him, but from east to west it was five miles wide.
            Twelve battalions of the Fourth Army, twelve thousand men now bolstered by
            the Tenth Division, lay in wait.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            To his right, at the tip of the clearing, a knobbly hill rose and swelled to
            the east, disappearing behind the col trees. Somewhere beyond, the hill
            dipped and terminated in a sheer cliff, the Demerero River coiling about its
            base. To William’s left, propped against the deepest recesses of the col’s
            roots, was Renn Vigast, chewing a col leaf that he had snatched from the
            air.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘This will go splendidly,’ Renn, a petty noble from Austglen, whispered. The
            Calmodians had made a probing attack here the day previous. Their foe had
            waited patiently, testing the glade’s fortifications with methodical intent
            whilst their air force abraded the Gildaynean lines. They had driven the
            Gildayneans back from the glade, though they had sustained substantial
            casualties themselves and had retreated, unable to maintain the position.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The rest of the company murmured as they lay in foxholes or behind pocked
            sandbags. Autocannon teams waited, hidden in brambles and clefts in the
            soil. A scribbled line of Gildaynean carcasses wound through the trees,
            disappearing over the undulations of Hannipt’s bed. Most were in foxholes,
            but many had been caught out of cover, slung corpses shredded by a hail of
            Calmodian steel.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William could not help but stare at the bodies strewn about him.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Shut up and stop hiding in the shade,’ William whispered back to Renn,
            glancing nervously at the steep hill that descended into the glade. He held
            his rifle steady. A hand fell on William’s shoulder. It was Tamper.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Steady?’ the sergeant asked.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Steady.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William cast a glance to the east where the hill rose. Privates Amon and
            Gregory crouched in a ditch crested by sandbags to his right; beyond them,
            Robert and Lou lay prone under the wide leaves of a berrybush.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Sergeant, are you and your men ready for this? Remoras say Cal’s on the
            way, be here any minute now.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William looked over his shoulder and saw that Captain Cobbler had crawled
            through the foliage. Tamper nodded.  William noticed, for the first time,
            that a dead radioman lay next to Tamper. He held his radio in his lap; the
            device had been struck by some explosive munition that had punched a hole
            clean through, its mechanical guts mingling with the innards of its
            operator. The radioman, no more than a youth, reminded William of James
            Weaver.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘They’re ready, captain,’ Tamper said, his steel helmet low over his face.
            He was calm. Tamper didn’t tear his eyes away from the iron sights of his
            Lantus autorifle, its compact wooden frame tucked firmly into his shoulder,
            the barrel short and ribbed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Fucking fantastic,’ Cobbler said, his white teeth stark against his muddied
            face. ‘Remember, wait for them to commit to the glade before you open fire.
            Keep them pinned. The Syspirron will take the flank and rear. You need to be
            ready to move if Cal pushes up the hill.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Cobbler was about to crawl away when Renn whispered frantically at him.
            ‘Captain, do they have aegises?’ Cobbler rolled onto his back to face Renn.
            William, in a moment of near hysteria, almost burst out laughing as he was
            reminded of the nude muses of Kamenetz that he had so often painted.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Remoras haven’t seen any, but that doesn’t mean they’re not there. Now shut
            up and stop hiding in the shade.’ The captain crawled away.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William smiled as Renn, grumbling, took up position beside him and hoisted
            his rifle. ’What I’d do to be stationed in Dorume. They’re probably watching
            all of this from the tip of the World Spine, commenting on how fucking droll
            it would be to be serving in Syspirro.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Perhaps a tour in Dorume would have been less impressive for Mother?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A laugh strangled before it could carry across the glade. ‘Fuck you,
            William.’ The half-hour spent in the mud and sweat was sluggish in its
            passing.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A radio nearby brrrped. ‘They’re coming.’ Tamper said softly, rolling his
            shoulder and adjusting his grip. He adjusted the sights on his autorifle.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William squinted and looked forward. After moments of seemingly complete
            stillness, he saw the enemy advance.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodians barely made a sound as they moved through the forest. Their
            steps were the rustle of leaves as they darted from trunk to trunk, their
            mottled uniforms blending in seamlessly with their surroundings; they were
            only visible when they moved. There was no steady drumbeat of marching feet,
            nor the bellows of command. There was only the wind and the distant symphony
            of war.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William’s brow furrowed as the Calmodians approached. He had expected
            something different, something unusual with the appearance of their foe, but
            he had also expected them to be fundamentally similar in uniform and
            equipment. They were not. As they drew nearer, his artist’s eye caught the
            detail of the cowled invaders. The Calmodians approached, nimble despite
            their thick armour and heavy tabards and cloth faulds. Their helmets were
            smooth and matte, save for the bug-eyed lenses that glinted glossy and black
            as the sun peeked through the canopy. Their uniforms, which must have been
            hellishly hot in Syspirro’s clime, were camouflaged soil to the naked eye.
            Gloved hands that reached to the elbow, like a smelter’s mittens, clutched
            long-barrelled rifles, the magazines under the receivers large and round
            like bulging metal guts.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William paused, closed one eye, and aimed down his own rifle. They were
            reaching the edge of the glade now.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodians became wary as they came to the clearing. They hesitated.
            Some moved up the hill but did not go far.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            There was no cover to be had if they were to cross, but the glade was but
            one of many that pocked Hannipt’s rainforest. If they wanted to push through
            to Lunonen, they would have to cross the clearings.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Other battles still raged in the north, west, and southwest, though their
            tumult had diminished in William’s ears. The armies of the Fourth and Sixth
            were surrounded in Hannipt as the Calmodian forces had enveloped from the
            north and marched from Portlock. Fort Lunonen was their only redoubt in this
            hellish forest, and there would be no retreat. William’s heart pounded.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Wordlessly, the Calmodians emerged from the forest. They were great in
            number. They moved forward in a loose row of lines, spread out from one
            another.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A rumbling in the distance. ‘Aegis,’ Tamper said quietly. Renn cursed.
            William hissed at him to be quiet. The Calmodians were halfway across the
            glade now. They were hunched, ghoulish in their stature and alienness. On
            the right flank, more Calmodians emerged and began moving up the hill.
            Tamper cursed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The rumbling grew louder, the bellow of combustion more prominent.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William licked his lips. The trigger felt slick.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A slate grey shape trundled behind the marching troops; trees were brushed
            aside and crushed, cracking and snapping loudly.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Two hundred feet from the Gildaynean line of the glade they came.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            With a belch of black smoke, the aegis broke through the treeline, its
            treads revolving slowly as it lumbered forward. A group of infantry came in
            its wake, half-crouching as they hurried in a double column behind it.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The aegis had completely left the forest and was gaining speed when two more
            broke the treeline on either side. Then another three. Behind them,
            Calmodians increased their pace and rushed into the glade. William’s finger
            hovered over the trigger.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Fire!’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As the order rippled down the line, the Gildaynean bellow pipes sounded,
            their calls resounding through the field.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William pulled the trigger, the rifle bucking back into his shoulder and
            rattling the bones in his hands. A Calmodian crumpled and fell, his carcass
            hidden by the grass.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The clearing erupted into a kaleidoscope of light as tracers flew.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodians nearest to the Gildaynean line fell like shorn wheat and did
            not rise again. Behind, Calmodians threw themselves to the ground and, lying
            prone, returned fire. The Calmodians did not use bolt-action rifles; more
            akin to Tamper’s autorifle, Cal’s standard-issue armament spat rapidly into
            the Gildaynean lines, shredding earth and flesh.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The foremost Calmodian aegis shuddered to a halt while its accompaniment
            took cover behind it. They poked their heads out from behind the metal beast
            and fired.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            One Calmodian was unlucky as a Gildaynean bullet smashed through his bugeye
            lens and exploded out the back of his head, shattering the helmet into
            splinters.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William fired repeatedly, ducking his head behind the shattering col root as
            he drew the bolt or took fire. Renn worked wordlessly to his left, his
            movements mechanical as he ducked, reloaded, fired.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Spiralling contrails shot across the glade as three Gildaynean squads fired
            their impaler rockets into the nearest aegis. Two of the explosives hit at
            the wrong angle and ricocheted off into the treetops. The third scored a
            solid hit and erupted, though it did nothing but scorch the aegis’s hull.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The aegis’s cannon, as if in response, swivelled in smooth motions and
            methodically fired down the Gildaynean line.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The coaxial autoguns of the Calmodian aegises caused more havoc than their
            cannons. Three nozzles on each side of the machines fired into the forest,
            ripping through tree trunks and foxhole dirt, sailing through Gildaynean
            bodies in bloody bursts.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            More Calmodians took position among the trees on the other side of the
            clearing. William could hear the screams of the dying as if their lungs were
            being emptied right into his ears. The stench of blood and fuel and earth
            filled his nostrils.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Grenades were lobbed through the air by both sides, mutilating rather than
            outright killing more often than not, if the howls were any indication.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The aegises swivelled and fired again and again, creating craters in the
            line. One hit the col tree beside William.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The tree groaned and fractured, falling away from him. Splinters flew,
            scratching and bloodying his face, but he kept firing. He glanced as he
            reloaded; Renn was alright, his face bloodied and grim as he reloaded his
            own rifle. Screams seeped from the collapsed tree as more Gildayneans surged
            forward to fill in the gap.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The aegises shot down the line, fire eructing from their muzzles like
            clockwork.  Many Gildayneans fled before the machines’ wrath, fleeing to the
            rear positions.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A great eruption sounded from behind William. He didn’t turn as the
            Gildaynean aegises, positioned some distance behind the frontline, began
            firing on the Camodian war machines. William, who was no merchant nor
            curator of war, even he could tell the difference in quality between the
            metal beasts of the two nations. The Gildaynean aegises, the Snapperheads,
            they were much slower to fire, and their armaments were less accurate. From
            what William could see, the Calmodian aegises were larger and faster,
            manoeuvring about the battlefield with an agility he didn’t believe possible
            for the vehicles.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As another encroaching Calmodian fell in front of him, something tugged at
            his arm, skewing his aim as he fired. He turned and saw that Renn was
            pulling him back from the ruined col tree.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Tamper was shouting, but it took a moment for William to process what he was
            saying.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘The hill! They’re taking the hill!’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Renn pulled him again. He was surprisingly strong.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘We need to pin them down for the Syspirron!’ Tamper bellowed as they moved
            through the trees. Brine Company and half of Atoll Company bounded down the
            shallow trenches into the forest as Tamper led the way.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A thought latched to William’s thoughts like a symbiotic growth. I have
            killed. He had killed at least three men; he had seen the pink mist surge
            from them. I have killed. He followed Tamper.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The men of Atoll and Brine, one hundred and sixty of them, dove behind
            sandbags strewn about the shelled remains of an outpost placed at the hill’s
            crease. A meagre concrete fortification had been erected, its walls marred
            with small black pits.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A handful of soldiers were already shooting at the advancing Calmodians;
            they came in throngs through the woods, darting up the hill. Snug in a cleft
            between two sandbags, a private manned an autocannon and sprayed into the
            broiling mass before him, its barrel running hot before automatic fire from
            Cal ripped through his chest.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Renn and William took position together behind the sandbags. Beside them,
            Robert and Gregory manned the autocannon. Robert wrested the dead private
            off the gun as Gregory replaced the ammo belt. Amon stood, frozen and out of
            cover, before Lou Baker grabbed him by the collar and yanked him to the
            ground.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘You’re right, Mother would find this much more impressive!’ Renn shouted at
            William, a smiling snarl on his face as he aimed over the sandbags. A bullet
            ricocheted off his steel helmet and he sprang back down. Others were not so
            lucky.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A grenade, sailing in a smooth arc over the barricade, thudded into soft
            earth between the men of First Squad. Lou, standing in front of Amon who was
            prostrate and curled before the barricade, promptly threw it back.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Where the fuck are those bark-eaters?’ Captain Cobbler screamed. He stood,
            bent over like an old man as he made to shift between cover, perhaps to gain
            a better vantage of the hillock before him, when a bullet caught him in the
            throat.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William, his back to the spilling sand of the punctured bags, peered over
            the barricade as men cowered down beside him. The Calmodians were almost on
            them. He saw them running up the hill, where the Syspirron should be
            gathered. He lowered his head and, breathing evenly, he reloaded his rifle.
            He was almost out of ammunition.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Where are the Syrpirron?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A small, yellow object landed a few feet in front of him. It exploded.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William felt as if the sun had suddenly materialised before him. He felt
            heat on his face and saw only white, searing white. A brace of bells rang
            inside his ears in a bid to crack his skull open. He fell to the ground and
            writhed in pain, or at least he thought he did, as he could perceive nothing
            but that pain.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Seconds or hours passed, and he began again to perceive shapes. He blinked
            hard. He was lying on his back, facing the barricade. His ears still rang,
            and the sounds of battle were dampened, but he took no notice.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            His attention was consumed by the Calmodian standing on the sandbags.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Stark and terrible against the skyline, the man seemed inhumanly tall, his
            otherness accentuated by the bulging glossy eyes set in his helmet.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Wiping blood from his eyes, William could see that the Calmodian was holding
            a shotgun.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A figure lurched toward the Calmodian. Renn. Or Amon?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodian raised his weapon and shot from the hip, the muzzle flash
            reflected momentarily in his helmet’s eyes. The figure fell.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William frantically scrambled backward, clawing for his rifle. Figures
            groaned in the dirt beside him.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodian swivelled on his hips and levelled the shotgun at William.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William closed his eyes. Half a dozen, rapid heartbeats passed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The gunshot did not come.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A deafening torrent of voices in a foreign language swept over him; the
            Calmodians were going to overrun them.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William opened his burning eyes. The Calmodian was still standing on the
            barricade, but he was looking up the hill and pointing with a thickly gloved
            hand.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Though his ears still rang, he could hear the Calmodian shouting through his
            strange helmet in a lilting voice that he could not understand.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A cataclysmic chorus of foreign tongues rang through the glade.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William, not daring to hope, groped for his rifle, or any rifle that might
            have lain in the mud.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Though he could not understand in that moment, the cacophony of foreign
            voices that were reaching a crescendo were not Calmodian.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            They were Syspirron.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A mottled green blur sped past the Calmodian.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William watched, fascinated, as the soldier’s head simply disappeared; a
            spurt of blood squirted from the cleaved neck. The body fell backward and
            landed into the bed of soft soil with a soft thud. The head fell between
            William’s legs.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Inhuman screams tore through the forest, sending shivers up William’s spine
            like no artillery salvo could. Crawling back to the fortifications, he
            looked through a gap that had been blasted in the sandbags. He hadn’t
            believed the stories about the Syspirron, and he couldn’t believe them now.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A battalion of Syspirron riders coursed down the hillock and bore down upon
            the Calmodian flank, a ceaseless wave crashing upon a crumbling rock. The
            Syspirron were resplendent in crimson silks, azure silks, ribbons trailing
            from the horns that tipped their battle visors, masks that depicted
            grinning, nightmarish visages. Though all the Syspirron riders carried small
            carbines on their backs, most wielded long and curbed sabres that fell and
            rose as they tore among their quarry, dragging arced tapers of blood into
            the air. The Syspirron screamed like demons as they hacked and thrust about
            themselves with a terrible and beautiful ferocity as they sheared through
            Calmodian helmets and skulls.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William was awestruck, but not by the riders. His mouth hung agape as he
            watched their steeds rip into the Calmodian infantry.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The snarling and scaled simurs, taller than the largest warhorse, loped down
            the hill on all fours, pouring into the glade, decimating the Calmodians
            caught in the open. The simurs darted amongst the surprised soldiers with
            astonishing speed. Their large, triangular heads lunged forward, savagely
            biting into flesh and latching on like a limpet, wrenched back and forth
            until the Calmodians between their jaws went limp. William, even behind the
            barricade, could hear the bones being ripped out of sockets as the great
            lizards rent flesh from bone. The simurs lashed out with muscular forearms
            and kicked with powerful hindlegs, mutilating with ease. Blood spilled like
            fountain water before the beasts. The odd armour that the Calmodians wore
            did nothing to stop the onslaught; the emerald nightmares swung their
            scythe-tipped tails with savage abandon.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodians fired at the oncoming horrors, aiming at the simurs rather
            than the riders. Most hit their mark, but they did not fell the lizards.
            Rather, the bullets seemed only to enrage the beasts.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A single Calmodian, his helm marked with a red chevron, stood his ground and
            aimed his rifle carefully. He fired. The bullet caught a Syspriron rider
            centre mass and unseated him. The riderless simur, enraged, devoured the
            distance to the Calmodian and disembowelled him.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The aegises in the glade had turned to shoot into the approaching cavalry.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Twisting gun nozzles spluttered into the crowd of Syspirron. The aegis
            closest to the reptilian flood fired its main cannon twice, atomizing a
            cluster of riders and their mounts. As a brace of simurs fell, bifurcated by
            the blast yet still lashing out at any Calmodians fool enough to approach,
            more poured into the glade.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A trio of simurs and their riders darted to the flank of the nearest aegis.
            The simurs, their heads bowed low, rammed into the aegis in unison, lifting
            it off its treads. With incomprehensible strength, the simurs pushed and
            pushed, their long forearms supporting the motion as they toppled the aegis.
            As the war machine rolled onto its back, the three Syspirron riders jumped
            onto its belly; after a moment, a hatch in the machine’s underside opened.
            Two of the Syspirron, their carbines unslung, fired into the hatch. The
            third dropped a grenade inside. They jumped back onto their steeds and
            re-joined the fray. The grenade went off, and blood and shrapnel erupted
            from the aegis’s gut.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A resounding cheer rose from the Gildayneans down the line as the unending
            Syspirron stream filled the glade.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William staggered to his feet and surveyed his surroundings. The forest
            floor was littered with bodies. A few men moved about the barricade,
            searching for survivors. The fingers of the decapitated Calmodian spasmed in
            front of him. About to turn away, William paused. From the Calmodians
            helmeted head ran a tube, cleanly cut by the simur’s tail. The other end of
            the tube ran into a large metal tank attached to the Calmodian’s back.
            Picking up his rifle, the thought niggled at him. He couldn’t explain why.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William stumbled to where Renn had fallen. The body was face down. William
            knelt, grimacing as he rolled the corpse over. It wasn’t Renn, but a soldier
            that he did not recognise.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Renn?’ William called, cupping his hands about his mouth to diminish the
            din, though it did nothing. ‘Renn?’ Beside him, Robert and Gregory moved
            sluggishly, clutching their heads and rubbing their eyes. Lou dragged Amon
            under the arms, the young man’s face slack and pale; the Fourth Army veteran
            took the moment of reprieve to drag Amon behind the front line.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William, ignoring the rest of his squad, turned over another body, another
            unknown private who had had taken a bullet to the heart. He rested a bloody
            hand on the sandbags and took a moment to breathe. Where the fuck did he go?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Tend not the dead, soldier. Hannipt will care for them.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William looked up and recoiled.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            An amber simur eye scrutinised him over the barricade with a curious
            intelligence. Fetid breath puffed from a slit nostril as the beast proudly
            reared its cerulean crown. Three horns, connected by black webbing,
            protruded from the simur’s head. A gangly Syspirron sat lazily in the
            saddle, his black mask depicting a laughing, broken-toothed face. A fine
            sabre of smoked steel hung from his hip and red leather reins dangled
            loosely in his hands. A dozen other riders waited nearby; they watched
            William intently, their carbines at the ready.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The rider with the laughing mask sighed. ‘You Gildayneans let us do all the
            work, then you will take all the credit. Bah! Typical.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            His accent was thick, his hidden mouth moving around the Gildan words as if
            he were rolling marbles in his mouth.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            An explosion sounded nearby. William looked west. The Calmodians were being
            pushed back from the east, though they remained stubborn in the face of the
            envelopment. Laughing Mask said something in Syspirron to his fellows. They
            barked, their laughter harsh and out of place as the fighting continued.
            William’s gaze turned back to the Syspirron before him; oil-black eyes
            glistened behind the mask, staring keenly at him, as if waiting.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William, moving slowly, picked up a rifle; it lay in the mud like a
            proffered sword.  The riders on the other side of the barricade bristled. He
            raised a hand placatingly and turned, intent to search for the Renn.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A shout came from behind him. William turned to see the Syspirron riders
            moving their simur toward him. The man with the broken mask nonchalantly
            raised his hand and the riders stopped immediately.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘They want to kill you, Gildaynean,’ Laughing Mask said. Could a smile be
            heard in those words?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Why would that be?’ William said, trying to sound braver than he felt as
            his voice cracked like he had just been thrust into pubescence. ‘We’re all
            on the same side, aren’t we?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Same side, yes, this is knowledge known,’ Laughing Mask said. ‘But manners
            lacked are a grievous insult here in Syspirro. Would you turn your back on
            your King Austrum before he gave his dismissal?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Syspirro has no king,’ William said, irritated at the lax nature of this
            Syspirron.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Laughing Mask shifted in his saddle and leaned down, the simur beneath him
            shaking its head vigorously and yawning as it did so, pink membrane
            stretching over jagged teeth.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As Laughing Mask moved, William could see his cloth tunic was emblazoned
            with an emblem: a scarlet diamond bisected by three azure lines. The
            Syspirron royal crest.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘No,’ Laughing Mask said, whispering as if to confide in William, ‘but it
            does have a prince, and your life was sheltered by his hand.’ The man pulled
            off his mask, revealing a sallow face beneath, a face that William had seen
            plastered everywhere in the streets of Portlock; the face of Prince Mura of
            Syspirro.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William paled as he realised his mistake and quickly bowed his head. Mura
            laughed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘That is more like it, fish-fucker.’ He reclined in the saddle and patted
            the simur on its thick neck.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A twig snapped and the prince’s guards stood in their saddles; the simurs
            growled, their intonations ending in low hisses. Mura, a bored expression on
            his face, looked over William’s shoulder. ‘Approach,’ he said. Sergeant
            Tamper stepped in beside William. He bowed deeply, his arms rigid at his
            sides, as was the Syspirron way.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Prince Mura. It is an honour,’ Tamper said.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘I would imagine so. To us you have something to say?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Your Majesty, I don’t know what information you have but our scouts report
            that the Calmodians aren’t retreating. They’re digging in at the western
            edge of the clearing.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘What of it, soldier? My riders are eating up their flank. It matters not
            that they dig their heels to the ground.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘We have intel that Calmodian aegises are retreating from the forest’s edge,
            they’re not moving into to support their ground troops. Surely there is a
            reason—’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Mura waved his hand dismissively. ‘They know they cannot best simur riders,
            this is apparent to all.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Your Majesty, perhaps it is best to err on the side of caution—’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Begone from me, Gildaynean. Return to your shoals. I will not flee with a
            tail tucked, not while Syspirro cries.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Mura turned from them and kicked the horned simur in the ribs. The creature
            emitted a reverberating bellow and ambled down the glade, gaining speed as
            it melted into the ever-flowing river of Syspirron riders, the prince’s
            guard following closely behind. Tamper wasted no time in contemplating
            Mura’s decision.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Atoll! Brine! On me! We’re re-positioning to that hill,’ Tamper bellowed.
            He didn’t wait for an answer and began sprinting. The companies followed. As
            William ran, Renn stumbled into step beside him. He grinned at William, his
            face streaked with blood.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Great gouges scarred the soil and trees were knocked askew where the simur
            had charged. Some of the great beasts had been felled by a torrent of
            Calmodian bullets, along with their riders; the Syspirron who had survived
            their steeds knelt by the simur corpses, weeping.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A collar of rock, some thirty feet high, jutted from the northern face of
            the hill. Reaching the crest, the companies set about bolstering the
            position. General Kerghast had ordered that only a small contingent of
            Gildayneans occupy the hilltop before the engagement so as not to draw Cal’s
            attention; they had all been slaughtered by the Calmodians, who had in turn
            been slaughtered by the Syspirron.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The hilltop had no constructed fortifications save for a meagre trench
            system that ran along the summit’s circumference; its lines of barbed wire
            had been trampled by the Syspirron. Tamper ordered the companies to erect
            rifle shields along the top of the trench, to place sandbags and fill the
            gaps in the defence. They obeyed. There were two storerooms in the trench
            where they found the required materials, as well as two ‘25 Wertmire
            repeater cannons; they were promptly deployed on the cusp of the trench.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘William! Renn!’ The two privates handed the ammunition belts they were
            carrying from the storeroom to a pale private from Atoll; they could hear
            the munitions jingling on the youth’s neck as they sped to their sergeant at
            the fore of the trench. Tamper stood before a portable radio pack. ‘William,
            you know how to use this,’ he said. ‘Herwyn is dead.’ Herywn was Brine
            Company’s radio operator. William nodded and hoisted the radio onto his
            back.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘I want the two of you to climb that rock face,’ Tamper said, gesturing
            towards the sharp outcrop to the north. ‘I want vantage on any
            counterattacks. Renn, you go with him and provide him cover. If you spot Cal
            coming, return immediately.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘Won’t the Syspirron take care of them?’ Renn asked.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Tamper laughed harshly. ‘The Syspirron will plunge where the fighting is
            thickest; the fighting will not be thickest here, but I’ll be damned if I
            give the Calmodians a site of elevation. Hop to it.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William and Renn set off, running past the scrabbling men of the companies
            and out of the trench.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The rock was not far away from the trench. It rose up from the side of the
            hill like smeared paint scraped and dried to stone, its tip narrow and
            jagged. William and Renn approached the eastern side of the outcrop where
            there was a steep but manageable incline. It brought them unnervingly close
            to the hill’s edge and a sheer cliff with a precipitous drop. William,
            momentarily forgetting himself, could not help but stare at the sight of
            Hannipt below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Before him, colossal smokestacks stained the skyline. Lower Hannipt sprawled
            as far as the eye could see, a sea of emerald treetops peppered with
            devastating blazes. Blinding flashes, great and small, twinkled in the
            depths of the forest to the northeast, where the Sixth guarded the northern
            passage to Lunonen. William’s breath caught in his throat; countless fires
            burned as Calmodian aircraft ruled the skies, flying in quartets like
            whirling hawks as they descended upon the pockets of Gildayneans spread
            throughout Hannipt.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The sun was setting, its bloodred shades fusing with the black brush strokes
            of smoke, but no man who fought in Hannipt that day was cognisant of it.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            He looked over the precipice. Far below, through the leaves of cols that
            hung from the cliff, he could see the Demerero flowing. It was a sheer drop;
            the simurs were excellent climbers it seemed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘William.’ Renn, dark rings under his eyes where there none that morning,
            was looking at him oddly. ‘Are you alright?’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William smiled. ‘Yes.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Renn nodded, his expression uncertain. William began climbing the rock face.
            The rock’s surface was composed of porous, cutting limestone. He moved
            carefully as he searched for purchase. The radio felt heavy on his back and
            sweat poured in torrents through his uniform. Eventually, about halfway up,
            he reached a small flat on the rock’s western side. William carefully
            unloaded the radio and pulled out a small but powerful pair of field
            binoculars.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            He removed the mouthpiece from the radio pack. ‘Tamper? DeLat reporting,
            acknowledge. Over.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Tamper’s distorted voice sounded immediately. ‘Acknowledge. Report on north
            of the glade. Over.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Peering over the northern slope of the rock, he held up the binoculars and
            scanned. He spoke into the mouthpiece. ‘There are some Syspirron driving the
            Calmodians back on their lines; they have them on the run. Over.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            ‘What about the west? Over.’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The sun sank further into the horizon.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William swung the binoculars to his left and peered down into the glade.
            From his perch, he witnessed little dioramas of the battle. Five miles away
            a large outcrop of Calmodians fought along the western perimeters of the
            glade. Six Calmodian aegises blasted into the Syspirron, though the machines
            themselves seemed to be retreating deeper into the depths of Hannipt.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Syspirron riders had split into two surging groups, both flowing into
            the trees on either side of the resisting Calmodians. Muzzle flashes in the
            trees demarked more entrenched Calmodians deeper in the northern woods.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Masses of Gildayneans rushed from the south to the frontline, making their
            way toward the firefight.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            He swept the binoculars back to Cal’s line of defence and frowned. They had
            stopped firing and were throwing themselves to ground. To surrender so
            easily after all of that?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The sun had almost disappeared now, its dying light steeping the sky in
            gold.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            William held the mouthpiece to his mouth. ‘Calmodians are dug in at the
            western edge of the glade. Several platoons to the northwest. Syprirron are
            taking the flanks. Aegises are retreating from—’
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodian missile plunged into the earthen heart of Hannipt Forest.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The missile had rocketed from a Calmodian stratobomber thirty seconds
            earlier, breaking the sound barrier as it hurtled towards the battleground.
            It struck the locus of the Syspirron surge. A dark cloud of forest soil
            swelled upwards hundreds of feet into the air. The brute concussive force of
            the initial shock was enough to vaporise beast and man where it landed.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Upon impact, the missile’s tip exploded, releasing its payload of liquid
            fire. In a fraction of a second, the blooming chemical cocktail, released
            from its cage, tasted the oxygen and spread rapidly in search of more.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In the blink of an eye the glade was immersed in hellfire. The Syspirron and
            Gildaynean soldiers drenched in it rolled futilely as they tried to quench
            the clinging flames, their cries drowned out by the expanding crimson
            maelstrom.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The piercing shrieks of the simurs were the only sounds to break the roar of
            sweeping flame. Blood boiled and skin turned to crackling as the wave of
            broiling red fury engulfed the forest. The Gildayneans fled from their
            defensive line, the whip of terror licking at their soles as they stampeded
            from the flames.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Blinded by the searing torrent, the immolated forces of the Syspirron and
            Gildayneans could not see the shadowed figures that now walked amongst them.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The masked, bug-eyed Calmodians had stepped into the glade. Their heavy
            armour, so laborious to wear in the close heat of Hannipt, now protected
            them entirely from the chemical fire that raged about them.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As the fire blossomed, the Calmodians walked through the burning glade, the
            long blades in their hands reflecting the dancing flames. Most of the
            survivors, badly burnt and writhing, were found on the edges of the glade.
            With determined precision, the bug-eyed soldiers put a comforting hand over
            the eyes of their foes and sunk their knives between ribs into fading
            hearts.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The fire, hungering, leapt from blade to root to trunk, its greed pulling it
            into the forest. In moments, even the tallest trees beside the glade were
            doused in the crimson tide, their branches dripping scorching death.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The skies, as if furious at this terrible happening, roiled. Stratus
            gathered over the battlefield. The bed of Hannipt began to seethe from the
            encroaching fire, but something else stirred in the dark forest; starting as
            a fine mist, then gathering into fat droplets, rain began to fall upwards
            from the soil, slowly at first, then rising in a torrent.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The skies flashed as, for the first time in living memory, a snapstorm
            formed above the Syspirron mainland. The rains, conducted under thunderous
            direction, endured the fires and swept into the sky, the trees and flames
            whipping into a frenzy as the wind swept its wrath across Hannipt.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Calmodian inferno was not doused, nor could it be, but the storm, this
            small miracle, kept the conflagration at bay, enveloping the glade and
            halting the fire’s advance.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            To the dying, it did not matter.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The last man in that nameless glade fell.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The sun set.
        </p>
