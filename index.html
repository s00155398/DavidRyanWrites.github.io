            He took his usual seat at the front of the diner.  

            Again, for the third week in a row, there were no other patrons in Mme Gauche’s. He did not need to wonder why. It was 4am, and though there was no official curfew, none who valued their lives would wander the streets of Fauborg Marigny once the sun had set. Most wouldn’t anyway. 
            
            Night Officer Arnaud Berthier lay his newspaper flat on the counter’s surface and lit a cigarette. A cup of black coffee, steaming, was already waiting for him. He glanced at the mug, looked up to see where she was; he could hear her in the back, making a racket. He noticed that there was a tattered book on the counter, at the far end of the diner. He tilted his head and read the spine. The Inkspots played quietly from a radio by the cooker. The music suffused with the aroma of grease and coffee and tobacco. There was also the pungent scent of garlic, as a dozen cloves hung from the ceiling behind the counter. He breathed in deeply and bathed in the smells and the sounds and found reprieve. It had been a long night.  
            
            He had just started reading the newspaper when she came in. He tore his eyes away from the headline: ‘2nd AUGUST 1963 - NIGHT POLICE REINSTATED IN LOUISIANA AS INFESTATION TAKES HOLD’. He glanced back at the paper and pretended to read it as she went about refilling the coffee pots, though there was no one else to serve. He clenched his jaw; he could feel a blush seeping into his cheeks like he was some damned schoolboy. 
            
            The Inkspots faded away to soft crackling as the signal was interrupted. He watched out the corner of his eye as she tutted. He heard her smack the radio. His eyes were pinned to the newspaper, a muddle of characters and monochrome photos that he couldn’t discern right now. 
            
            ‘Piece of shit!’ 
            
            He glanced up, hoping perhaps that she was talking to him. No, just the radio. Why would you want her to call you a piece of shit anyway, you piece of shit? He shook his head and took a swig from the coffee. Two sugars. She’d remembered. Again. He inhaled as if to speak, and thought better of it. 
            
            She walked behind the counter and he shifted in his seat, his head low over the newspaper. She hummed softly to herself as she went about her business. He thought maybe it was Chopin that she was humming. Say something. What’s the worst that could happen? She thinks you’re a fucking idiot and you find some other hole to wait in until you’re redeployed to New York. Elvis replaced the Inkspots. He couldn’t stand Elvis. 
            
            Thud. He looked up, the half-cindered cigarette dangling from his mouth. He leaned over the counter to see what had fallen; a clove of garlic rolled on the turquoise vinyl floor. She sighed and stooped to pick it up. He blanched as she stood, as he hadn’t the time to look away. She met his gaze. 
            
            Arnaud, when he had fought in Vietnam, had once seen a cargo barge capsize in the bay of Saigon. The captain had lost control of the rudder and ran straight into the concrete barrier of the bay, just short of the open ocean. A gouge had been torn into the hull of the
