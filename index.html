        <pre>
            He took his usual seat at the front of the diner. 

    Again, for the third week in a row, there were no other patrons in Mme Gauche’s. He did not need to wonder why. It was 4am, and though there was no official curfew, none who valued their lives would wander the streets of Fauborg Marigny once the sun had set. Most wouldn’t anyway.

	Night Officer Arnaud Berthier lay his newspaper flat on the counter’s surface and lit a cigarette. A cup of black coffee, steaming, was already waiting for him. He glanced at the mug, looked up to see where she was; he could hear her in the back, making a racket. He noticed that there was a tattered book on the counter, at the far end of the diner. He tilted his head and read the spine. The Inkspots played quietly from a radio by the cooker. The music suffused with the aroma of grease and coffee and tobacco. There was also the pungent scent of garlic, as a dozen cloves hung from the ceiling behind the counter. He breathed in deeply and bathed in the smells and the sounds and found reprieve. It had been a long night. 

	He had just started reading the newspaper when she came in. He tore his eyes away from the headline: ‘2nd AUGUST 1963 - NIGHT POLICE REINSTATED IN LOUISIANA AS INFESTATION TAKES HOLD’. He glanced back at the paper and pretended to read it as she went about refilling the coffee pots, though there was no one else to serve. He clenched his jaw; he could feel a blush seeping into his cheeks like he was some damned schoolboy.

	The Inkspots faded away to soft crackling as the signal was interrupted. He watched out the corner of his eye as she tutted. He heard her smack the radio. His eyes were pinned to the newspaper, a muddle of characters and monochrome photos that he couldn’t discern right now.
	
    ‘Piece of shit!’

	He glanced up, hoping perhaps that she was talking to him. No, just the radio. Why would you want her to call you a piece of shit anyway, you piece of shit? He shook his head and took a swig from the coffee. Two sugars. She’d remembered. Again. He inhaled as if to speak, and thought better of it.

	She walked behind the counter and he shifted in his seat, his head low over the newspaper. She hummed softly to herself as she went about her business. He thought maybe it was Chopin that she was humming. Say something. What’s the worst that could happen? She thinks you’re a fucking idiot and you find some other hole to wait in until you’re redeployed to New York. Elvis replaced the Inkspots. He couldn’t stand Elvis.

	Thud. He looked up, the half-cindered cigarette dangling from his mouth. He leaned over the counter to see what had fallen; a clove of garlic rolled on the turquoise vinyl floor. She sighed and stooped to pick it up. He blanched as she stood, as he hadn’t the time to look away. She met his gaze.
	
    Arnaud, when he had fought in Vietnam, had once seen a cargo barge capsize in the bay of Saigon. The captain had lost control of the rudder and ran straight into the concrete barrier of the bay, just short of the open ocean. A gouge had been torn into the hull of the vessel. The barge had been transporting dyes out of Saigon for trade in Canton or Macau or somewhere, he didn’t know. All he had known that day as he had walked the piers of that sweating city was the colour the waters had turned. The first dye to spill into the bay had been a light taupe, and it spread through the blue waters like an exploding nebula, a blossoming iris of tendrilled fawn suffused over ocean blue and dappled sunlight. That sight, amongst the horrors he had seen in Vietnam, had always stuck with him, a sight he held close to his heart, lest he forget to see the good of life.
	
    Her eyes were the colour of the bay of Saigon.
	
    He had looked into those eyes once before.
	
    She smiled. It was a crooked smile, one corner of the lip upturned, the other reluctant to complete the expression. She held the clove aloft. She stood close enough for him to know that she didn’t wear perfume; she merely smelled of freshly laundered clothes.
	
    ‘Can’t have these falling down or I might have to close up shop for good,’ she laughed. She had a light accent, a lilt of French that had been colonised over generations.
	
    ‘They don’t help.’
	
    She frowned, the lopsided smile still on her face. ‘Pardon?’
	
    Arnaud spoke mechanically, as if he couldn’t control his own tongue. ‘Garlic doesn’t help. Crosses don’t help. Holy water doesn’t help. Nocturnes don’t care about these things. Nocturnes will rip your throat whether it’s draped in cloves or wooden icons or blessed water. Only silver or stakes can stop nocturnes, and nothing else. Garlic is as good as a prayer; you may as well hang those, for all the good it does you.’
	
    ‘Why hasn’t Gauche’s been ransacked by the hickey-men then, oh you who is so wise in the ways of the night?’ He hoped he could hear a playful scorn in those words, but perhaps it was just scorn.
	
    ‘New Orleans is a big place. They don’t stray far from their broods, and Fauborg Marigny remains free of that curse for the moment.’
	
    She pursed her lips and turned away. ‘They’re more for the benefit of the customers, not that I get many,’ she said drily. ‘Whatever puts the mind at rest, right?’
	
    He started, almost leaping out of his plastic stool.
	
    ‘Wait, I’m terribly sorry. All this business of stalking the stalkers until the dawn has taken its toll. My profuse apologies. Let us start again. My name is Arnaud. Do you remember me, Tony?’
	
    That’s what he wanted to say. Instead, he sank back into his seat, collected his newspaper, and left.

    ‘When the night has come,

    And the land is daaaaaark …’

	Arnaud screwed his eyes shut. He sat in the passenger seat of a black Ford Fairlane. Amber light poured in through the window as they coasted slowly through the streets of Fauborg. It was 11pm, two hours into their shift, and he felt like punching Bernie. Ben E. King’s crooning was drowned out by the stocky Frenchman’s toneless singing.
	
    ‘Oh, I won’t be afraaaaaaaid …’
	
    ‘Bernie, for the love of Jesus, will you shut the fuck up?’ Arnaud said, not for the first time that night, not for the first time that month.
	
    Night Officer Henri Bernadotte, expressionless, turned the dial of the radio, increasing the volume of Stand By Me. He took a great breath and veritably screamed, ‘So darlin’, darlin’, staaaaa-aaand by me!’ Bernie laughed as Arnaud began cursing. Not one to give quarter, Bernie finished his rendition of the song before slamming a hammy fist on the console and turning off the radio. Arnaud muttered a small prayer.
	
    ‘You need to lighten up, mon ami,’ Bernie said as he came to a stop at a junction. The glare of neon, reds and greens and purples and pinks, spilled onto the asphalt, though the streets were silent. Arnaud scanned the wide streets before him like a hawk, astute to any disturbances that might arise this night. Bernie prattled on.
	
    ‘In this line of work, you need to keep the spirits high, sait tu l’esprit de corps, non?’ Bernie said as he turned the Fairlane down the main street of Fauborg. They passed by a late-night café; some of the patrons inside stared at the police cruiser as they sped by.
	
    ‘Some might say that that particular song might be grossly inappropriate for this line of work,’ Arnaud said. ‘Et mon esprit de corps is certainly denuded by your godawful singing.’
	
    ‘Fancy word for a lead-spitting tick like you.’
	
    Arnaud grunted.
    
    Like
    
    Arnaud, Bernie had also fought in Vietnam; at twenty-eight, he was ten years younger than Arnaud, but his tour in Asia had only lasted a month before he won the Night Officer lottery. Arnaud’s tour had last three years. Though born on American soil, Bernadotte’s parents were excessively French, and had instilled in their son a devout sense of social Darwinism. Bernie was fully assured that once the commies were ousted of southeast Asia that the United States would return Vietnam to France. Arnaud had never known what to make of this. 

    Though Bernie was a strange companion in a strange city, he was the only friend that Arnaud had managed to scrounge. Arnaud wasn’t sure whether or not he liked Bernadotte.
	
    Arnaud, looking out the window, raised a hand to Bernie. ‘Stop. Light.’ 
    
    Bernie pumped the brakes. The Fairlane lurched to a halt at the mouth of an alleyway. Arnaud took the controls of the roof-mounted spotlight and panned it towards the alley. Like the herald of God, Arnaud banished the darkness from that recluse to reveal what appeared to be two young men beside a dumpster. They were plunging syringes into their arms. Arnaud rolled his eyes as Bernie hastily took up the mouthpiece for the loudspeaker. Bernie loved talking to passersby in the night.
	
    ‘Bonsoir, salopes! Perhaps best to do that indoors if you want to see the dawn, no?’ Bernie said, his voice booming down the desolate street. One of the men jumped on the spot, startled, and fled further down the alleyway, lost from sight as he turned a corner. The other man turned and squinted into the spotlight. Even from this distance, Arnaud could see his pupils were dilated.
	
    ‘The bats don’t like tainted blood, man, it’s all good,’ the man in the alleyway said. He wore a corduroy jacket and a tattered pair of flared jeans. His hair was long and unkempt.
	
    ‘These fucking hippies, I swear to God,’ Bernie muttered to himself. Arnaud took the speaker off of him before he could begin his usual anti-anti-establishment tirade. He spoke into the mouthpiece and addressed the ragged man in the alleyway.
	
    ‘It’s not safe out here, you know that. Go get your friend and we’ll give you a lift home.’ Arnaud pursed his lips as the man grabbed his crotch.
	
    ‘Fuck you, pig. We ain’t going with you, and there ain’t nothing out here to fear! Ain’t no bats in New Orleans!’
	
    Bernie yanked the mouthpiece out of Arnaud’s hand. ‘Un cochon? Va te faire enculer, hippie!’ Bernie bellowed into the speaker.
	
    Arnaud threw the car door open. Whatever bravado the hippy had evaporated as Arnaud stepped out of the car; like his friend, he turned and bolted down the alleyway. Arnaud did not pursue. He climbed back into the car, and Bernie slowly drove off, shaking his head as he did so.
	
    ‘Why do you do that?’ Bernie asked.
	
    ‘Do what?’
	
    ‘Pretend we’re a taxi service?’
	
    ‘Because the fewer hippies on the streets means fewer chances for nocturnes to catch someone in the open, which means an easier job for us.’
	
    ‘Bah! I can agree with those hippies about one thing: there are no nocturnes in Fauborg. They’re all in Lakeview, supposedly, and this so-called infestation is nothing more than a couple of anciennes getting spooked by kids ringing the doorbells at night and asking to be invited in.’
	
    ‘You ever done the beat in Lafayette?’
	
    ‘No.’
	
    ‘If you had you’d know this isn’t kids ding-dong ditching. Four torn to shreds in less than six weeks, more than a dozen ‘missing’. And that whole fiasco with the maternity ward up in Baton Rouge, it’s—’
	
    ‘What maternity ward?’
	
    ‘A few Night Officers thought they’d tracked a nocturnus down to the Ney Maternity Hospital; they ended burning the whole place to the ground.’
	
    ‘They burned it down? They didn’t use the nitrate?’
	
    ‘No, they didn’t use the nitrate, because they panicked. Fucking amateurs. Besides, HQ said there was no nocturnus there after all.
    
    ‘What I’m saying,’ Arnaud continued, ‘ is that in New Orleans, Lakeview is the start, but it most certainly won’t be the end. So, maybe we should do our fucking job and keep the streets clear.’
	
    For once, Arnaud seemed to sour Bernie’s eternal irreverence; he took no joy in it. He had once been like Bernie. He had once been invigored and fired by his own infallible place in the world. Yes, he had been fired, but that was before he had witnessed true devastation, before he had seen forests and villages and the world itself succumb to the lick of the orange tide that smelled of old exhaust and wailed with many throats.
	
    He pushed those images from the borders of his mind. He thought of a lonely diner by the river in Fauborg, where there was no smell of petroleum or flaming wood or burning flesh. He inhaled deeply the scent of a memory of tobacco and black coffee and grease and freshly laundered clothes.
	
    They finished their patrol in silence, and there were no more disturbances in the night.
	
    ‘Are you coming to Hack’s this morning?’ Bernie asked as he pulled up into the police station. They stepped out of the car.
	
    ‘No, I’ve other plans,’ he said, plunging his hands into his pants pockets as he began strolling towards the river.
	
    ‘Coffee isn’t good for you after a shift!’ Bernie shouted at him.
	
    ‘Neither is tequila!’ Arnaud called back, his hand raised in departure.

    ‘The garlic’s gone.’
	
    He looked up from his newspaper. She stood by the cooker. He hadn’t heard her come in from the back. He grimaced and scratched the back of his head.
	
    ‘Sorry. I, uh, didn’t mean to frighten you last night.’
	
    ‘I live above the diner anyway; they can’t get in without an invite, right? Very safe in here.’
	
    ‘Sorry,’ he said again.
	
    She shrugged and said nothing else as she poured the milk into her mug. She leaned on the counter by the cooker and brought the mug to her mouth, staring at him as she did. Her mousey hair was tied up into a bun, her white blouse stark and stainless. Her name was emblazoned in blue stitching on her chest; Antoinette. He could only look into her eyes for a moment before he looked away; they were large and he shied before they could pull him in.
	
    ‘Another quiet night tonight,’ she said. It wasn’t a question.
	
    ‘What makes you say that?’
	
    ‘I used to live in Lafayette. Another fine diner in another sleepless city. Anyway, I worked nights there too and I was around when the first Night Officers were enlisted.’ She shook her head, her gaze vacant. ‘That diner was much busier, and the officers would come in after a shift and each night they’d be covered from head to toe in blood. Absolute degenerates paid no heed that I had to clean up their bloody slug trails every single night.’ She tutted. ‘Give me a choice between no business and bloody business and I’ll pick the former every time.’ She pointed at him. ‘If you ever come in here with a trail of blood in tow, I’ll kill you on the doorstep.’
	
    Not knowing what to say, he said, ‘I’m from Lafayette.’
	
    ‘This I know, Arnaud Berthier.’
	
    He raised his eyebrows in surprise. ‘You remember me?’
	
    ‘I do indeed.’
	
    ‘Why didn’t you say anything?’
	
    ‘I was wondering how long it would take you to pluck up the courage to say who you were. Let me tell you, working the nightshift in Gauche’s isn’t exactly entertaining, and there are only so many times I can read Les Contes du Cosmos. So, when you waltzed in here three weeks ago, I decided to play dumb and see what you’d do.’ She laughed heartily – it was a sort of gasping laugh – and the sound of it gladdened Arnaud. ‘I don’t remember you being so shy.’
	
    Arnaud smiled wanly. ‘A lot can happen in twenty years.’
	
    She grunted her agreement and looked down into her cup. 
	
    ‘How have you been, Tony?’
	
    Antoinette, or Tony as everyone in Lafayette called her, looked up and smiled. There was a genuine warmth in her eyes.
	
    ‘Where do I start?’ she laughed. ‘Twenty years is quite the timeline to cover.’
	
    Arnaud shrugged. ‘From the beginning is as good a place as any.’
	
    ‘The beginning,’ she repeated. She blew her lips out. ‘Where’s the beginning?
	
    ‘Well, let’s see. The last time I saw you, you and Louis had just left Barracuda Street for basic training in Fort Bliss. Heading off to France to shoot some Germans, I’m not entirely sure, no one ever really spoke about that whole thing in Europe after you both left. 
    
    ‘So,
    
    with Louis gone it was just me in the house with Maman et Papa, and let me tell you that was no picnic. While they were fretting over Louis getting shot by some Huns, I had to do all the chores in the café and I had to pretend to show an interest in talking to people and it was actually all quite horrible. ‘Let me storm the trenches of Europe!’ I cried every night as Papa made me clean out the toilets. ‘Let me bring democracy back to the peoples of Germany! Please, just don’t make me polish the windows again!’’
	
    Arnaud laughed. Tony’s brother, Louis, with whom he had been quick and fast friends as a teenager, had been gobbled up by the intelligence arm of the US Army. Arnaud had not been so lucky. The laughter faded. Tony continued.
	
    ‘I toiled and slaved in our little café for a whole year before I was able to escape like you and Louis. Except I escaped to college instead of boot camp, but I digress.’
	
    Arnaud rested his chin on his fist. ‘What did you study?’
	
    Tony saluted. ‘You are looking at the proud owner of a very useful major in French Literature.’ She shrugged. ‘And a minor in Sociology but the less I think about that the better.
	
    ‘After college, the world was my oyster, that’s what Maman kept saying to me, but little did she know that that particular oyster had its jaws firmly shut and there was no way I could prise them open. Very ambitious of me to think that French Literature would earn me a stable job, wasn’t it? So, back to Lafayette I went and I worked in the café for God knows how long and I got married and I bought a car somehow and I moved to New Orleans and you are not good at hiding your emotions.’
	
    Arnaud reeled. ‘Pardon?’
	
    Tony laughed. ‘The moment I mentioned that I got married your face fell like a drunk on the pavement. I didn’t know you long, Arnaud Berthier, but I always could tell you wore your heart on your lapel.’
	
    ‘Well, I … I …’ The more he stuttered the more she laughed, or gasped. He felt embarrassed, and he couldn’t help but sigh as she struggled to draw in a breath.
	
    ‘If only I had a camera for that,’ she said, wiping her eyes dry.
	
    ‘I’d rather you hadn’t.’
	
    ‘Maybe next time I’ll get a snapshot.’
	
    ‘Maybe.’
	
    ‘There you have it, anyway. Twenty years compressed into a very short and sad span of five minutes.’
    
    ‘How’s Louis? And your parents? I had thought about visiting them when I was last in Lafayette, but life gets in the way.’

	‘Louis is great. Living in Washington DC and has a whole clutch of little Louiss running around him. Working for some telecommunications firm, I’m not entirely sure because whenever he talks about it, I suddenly become deaf, it’s very odd. Maman et Papa, well they’re getting old, but that’s life at this age, isn’t it? They’re still pretty spry for the time being, but I feel I’ll have to return to Lafayette soon.’
	
    Arnaud nodded. ‘Good, that’s good.’
	
    ‘And what of you, Arnaud Berthier? What vast travels have you undertaken since I was seventeen? We haven’t heard any news from you in twenty or so years. It seems the Berthiers on Barracuda Street haven’t either.’
	
    
    He grunted. ‘Vast indeed. I don’t have much to recount. After the war in Europe, I remained in France for a time, in Marseille. I’d been part of the military police once Vichy had been liberated, so it made sense to me to continue my work there as a cop.’
	
    ‘How long were you in France for?’
	
    ‘About fourteen years.’
	
    ‘Did you get married?’
	
    ‘Almost.’ She’d grown tired of howling screams that awoke in the night.
	
    ‘Fourteen years,’ Tony said. ‘So, what happened in ’59?’
	
    ‘I came back to the States.’
	
    ‘And?’
	
    ‘And what?’
	
    ‘What did you do?’
	
    ‘I was sent to Vietnam.’
	
    Tony’s mouth fell open at this. Arnaud shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
	
    
    ‘Fresh off the boat and they sent you back to fight?’
	
    ‘Yes.’
	
    ‘Arnaud, I … were you in the thick of it?’
	
    ‘No,’ he lied.
	
    ‘That’s why you’re a Night Officer. You won the lottery.’
	
    ‘I don’t know if I’d call it winning, but yes.’
	
    ‘Arnaud, I’m—’
	
    ‘I know. I am too. Mais c’est ça. C’est impossible de tourner une tendance qui a déjà tournée.’ She stared at him, and he stared back. He felt a weight on his back, a constriction of the lungs that never relented. He opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted.
	
    She laughed at him.
	
    His mouth fell open as she doubled over, her hand clutched to her stomach. He felt an unbidden, angry blush creep up his neck.
	
    ‘What’s so damned funny?’ he said.
	
    Between gasps, she wheezed, ‘Fourteen years in Marseille and that’s your French! God help those poor bastards listening to that pig Latin!’
	
    ‘There’s nothing wrong with my French!’ he protested.
	
    ‘It’s your accent, Jesus Christ! That did not come from Lafayette!’
    
    This time, he could not help but join her in her laughter. He had always known that his American accent had disgruntled the French in Marseille; he’d always brushed it aside as the French being contentious, until now. For a few minutes, he laughed with her, and he felt that Sisyphean weight that clung to him like a cloak melt away.
	
    After that, conversation with Tony became much easier for him. He did not feel the catch in his throat that had itched him for three weeks or twenty years or so. They spoke of inane things, of New Orleans and college and Marseille and Lafayette and the neighbours and the dog that barked down the road. He was content.
	
    Eventually, there was a lull in conversation. She leaned easily on the counter across from him, and again he felt himself pulled into the wells of her eyes. She blinked slowly.
	
    ‘Well?’ she said, her voice husky from laughter.
	
    ‘Well, what?’
	
    ‘Are you going to ask me if I’m still married?’
	
    He hesitated. ‘Are you still—’
	
    ‘I am not. And I’m off tomorrow afternoon. Want to go for a walk in Crescent Park?’
	
    ‘I would love to.’
	
    She beamed at him. ‘It’s a date, Arnaud Berthier.’

    He wasn’t used to seeing the sun so high in the sky.
	
    It sat, languorous at the apex, bloated and throbbing in the clear autumn sky. He sweated, though it was not from the heat. He sat on a park bench, hunched over and staring at his feet. He held a brown paper bag with flowers; it dangled between his knees, a shivering cottonwood in his trembling hands.
	
    The park was packed. Under the beating summer heat mothers in bright dresses laughed after their children, dirtied and scratched and guffawing, as fathers ignored them, clustered on the benches like chain smoking buzzards. Stalls had been set along the thoroughfare, bursting square guts of hot dogs and candies and ice cream that melted too fast. The thrum of life sang through Crescent Park, a din of joy and contentment that shook the trees. Arnaud could not hear it.
	
    ‘I would say you scrub up well, but then I would be telling lies.’
	
    He glanced up. Tony stood before him, her hands clasped before her. She wore an egg blue summer dress with daisies embroidered across the chest. She grinned at him, and her smile seemed to drink up the sunlight of the park, the greater warmth consuming the lesser.
	
    Arnaud stood. ‘I thought I’d scrubbed pretty well.’ He was clean-shaven now, and he had put on his only Sunday wear: white loafers under tan slacks, a white shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbow. Tony looked him over and tutted. She reached behind his collar, her wrist brushing his neck. He flinched from the touch. She yanked and held aloft a bright white price tag.
	
    ‘You need to get out of the house more often,’ she said, throwing the tag into a nearby dumpster. ‘You’re as pale as a—’
	
    ‘Vampire?’
	
    ‘Well, I was going to say ghost, but whatever suits your fancy, Van Helsing,’ she laughed, touching his arm. He smiled, despite himself. He held the flowers up.
	
    ‘These are for you.’
	
    ‘Oh, flowers! I hate flowers!’
	
    He blanched, but she snatched the bag from his hands. He had bought her lilies.
	
    ‘Thank you very much, Arnaud Berthier. I’m no florist, but they’re very pretty,’ she said, grinning. She nodded towards the park.
	
    ‘Come on, let’s go for a stroll.’
	
    So they did. They bought ice creams by one of the vendors. Tony spoke to the vendor at length about the superiority of vanilla over chocolate. Arnaud had watched in amusement as the queue behind her lengthened, as the vendor became visibly irate, as she took no notice. After, they meandered down to the stream and sat on the grass and ate their sweating ice creams. When they’d finished, Tony sighed and lay back, draping an arm over her face. Arnaud sat up, his back bolt-straight; he watched some fish tenderly kissing the surface of the stream.
	
    They sat in silence for some time.
	
    ‘Les Contes du Cosmos,’ Tony said suddenly. She didn’t raise her arm from her face. Arnaud turned to her, frowning.
	
    ‘Pardon?’
	
    ‘The tattered book I always have in the diner. When are you going to start reading it?’
	
    ‘I hadn’t intended on starting.’
	
    She lifted her arm slightly and peered at him. ‘How do you mean to win my heart if you’re not going to read the books that I cherish so dearly? That’s why men read, isn’t it?’
	
    ‘Is it?’
	
    She tutted and lowered her arm again. He smiled wanly.
	
    ‘And is that my intent, Tony, to win your heart?’ he said.
	
    ‘Why else would you have followed me like a bloodhound from Lafayette?’
	
    ‘I didn’t know you were in New Orleans!’
	
    ‘A likely story, Arnaud Berthier.’ As he was about to object, she sat up and squinted at him, her teeth flashing in the sun. ‘Calm down, I know you’re not a stalker. I actually saw you do a double take the first night you passed Gauche’s and saw me through the window. I believe you walked back and forth four times before you summoned the courage to enter.’
	
    He shook his head and looked back to the stream. ‘You wound me so, Tony. I only walked by three times before I summoned enough courage. Only three.’ He turned back to her and saw that her smile had vanished. Her face was blank as she spoke.
	
    ‘Did you really think I’d forgotten you?’
	
    ‘I …’
	
    ‘Do you think I’d forgotten what you’d asked me before you and Louis shipped off to France?’
	
    He didn’t answer. She stared at him intently.
	
    ‘Do you still have it?’
	
    He swallowed hard. ‘Yes, I still have it.’
	
    ‘Show it to me.’
	
    He didn’t know why he felt such reluctance as he slipped a hand into his pocket. He retrieved his wallet, a battered thing that was falling apart at the seams. He flipped it open and pulled a tattered photo. Its monochrome was scratched and faded from old age, but the face of a pretty, pony-tailed woman with bright eyes was still clear on it. He handed it to her, and looked back to the stream.
	
    There were no sounds he could hear now, save for the brushing of the willows that stood along the bank. Their feathery leaves caressed the surface of the stream that gurgled, sighed as the wind wound through them.
	
    He knew he should say something. Say what he had always wanted to say. Say that he had thought of her ever since he had left Lafayette as a nineteen-year-old ignorant of the horror man could inflict upon man. Had thought of her every night when he’d awoken under the guns of the Wehrmacht or in the heavy heat of Ba Ria. Had thought of her every morning when he shut his eyes against the probing heat of the sun beyond the blinds. Had held her photo as a mental shield against the violence he had seen, the violence he had committed, a shield to block the view of his ruined humanity.
	
    He couldn’t. 
    
    He turned to her to apologise.
	
    As he did, she sprang forward and kissed him, and the fear and anguish and guilt of his lived life was forgotten for a moment.
	
    Only a moment, but a moment was enough.
    
    ‘… staaaaaaaaa-aaaaaa-aaaaaaand by meeeeee.’
	
    Arnaud, surprisingly, did not feel the plunging fingers of an encroaching migraine as Bernie screeched beside him. Tonight, Arnaud was driving, and had allowed Bernie to retain control of the radio on the dashboard. He checked his watch. 3am. Dawn was not far off. As with every other night in Fauborg, it had been a quiet one. No one in the streets, no one in the parlours. No sight of nocturnes. It was Thursday night, and they were coasting on Chartres Street which ran alongside the Mississippi. Though he had had the window rolled down, the air was heavy. It didn’t bother Arnaud. His mind was far from any scourge that lurked in the streets of New Orleans.
	
    This was not to last.
	
    Bernie turned off the radio. ‘Why’d you ask for leave tomorrow night? You’re going to leave me on the beat with Fitzgerald. I don’t like Fitzgerald.’
	
    ‘I don’t think Fitzgerald likes you either. You did say his wife looked like a donkey in a doily.’
	
    ‘Was I wrong?’
	
    ‘Beauty and the beholder and all that,’ Arnaud said.
	
    ‘Answer the question. As far as I can tell you’ve no social life to be taking days off for, so who died? You going to Lafayette? How long will you be gone for? Do you think Fitzgerald will hit me again if I talk shit about his wife? I like talking shit about his wife. You need to stop at a gas station, we’ve to fill her up before our shift is over. So how long will you be gone for?’
	
    Oh, wait, there it is, Arnaud thought as a migraine began to seep in. Bernie was unaware or unconcerned with Arnaud’s reluctance to answer; Arnaud knew he would not stop until he was satisfied.
	
    ‘If I tell you why I took personal leave for a single shift will you shut your fucking trap?’ Arnaud snapped.
	
    ‘Gladly!’
	
    ‘I have a date on Saturday. I want tomorrow off so I don’t fall asleep during it.’ After the afternoon spent in Crescent Park, he had spent the afternoon in her apartment above Gauche’s, had spent it in her bed, had spent it in her arms. When he’d left, she had asked him to go to the Cinerama with her on Saturday to see Day of the Triffids.
	
    ‘Mon Dieu, je peux pas le croire,’ Bernie said. ‘Is there something wrong with her?’
	
    ‘No.’
	
    ‘Come on, you can tell me, we’re pals, right?’
	
    ‘Are we?’
	
    ‘Arnaud, you hurt me so! Who did up the report after you tried to pick up those hippies?’
	
    ‘I did.’
	
    ‘I offered to do it though.’
	
    ‘You didn’t.’
	
    ‘Regardless. How exciting; old man Arnaud on a date, I never thought I’d see the day.’
	
    Arnaud felt the tug of a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. He suppressed it, though he couldn’t keep the levity out of his voice. He pulled the car under the fluorescent lights of a gas station; another Fairlane was parked outside. ‘Though I’d hardly say thirty-eight is ancient, it’s not beyond belief that I may have landed a date.’
	
    ‘Who is she? Is it the girl from the diner?’
	
    ‘Perhaps.’
	
    ‘What’s her name?’
	
    ‘Antoinette.’
	
    ‘Like Gill’s girlfriend. Is it Gill’s girlfriend you’re seeing? He won’t be happy if it is.’
	
    ‘It’s not Gill’s girlfriend.’
	
    ‘What are you going to do for your date?’
	
    ‘Get the shotgun.’
	
    ‘You’re going to get the shotgun?’
	
    ‘No, get the shotgun. Look, you fool!’
	
    Bernie turned his head towards the station and grew pale.
	
    Arnaud had parked the Fairlane in front of a brand-new Sinclair gas station. The green plastic shelling of the station’s transom had been polished and shone brightly under the buzzing lights. An assortment of comics and cartons of cigarettes with their cartoon mascots leered through the windows of the station. Beyond those, beyond the till which Arnaud could clearly see from where he sat, a spattering of blood was strewn across the tooth-white wall.
	
    ‘Get the shotgun,’ Arnaud repeated as he picked up the radio receiver from the centre console. Bernie complied quietly as Arnaud brought the receiver to his mouth.
	
    ‘Dispatch, we have a possible encounter at the Sinclair gas station, Chartres Street East. Send out a patrol.’
	
    ‘Copy,’ came the curt reply. Arnaud did not tear his gaze away from the storefront. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a small plastic vial; it was stuffed with cotton wool. Pinching some of the cotton, he jammed it into both ears. He yawned, making certain that he couldn’t hear. He exited the car.
	
    Bernie came around the side of the Fairlane with a shotgun in hand, a Remington 870 with a short stock. Arnaud pointed at his ears. Bernie pointed at his own ears and nodded.
	
    ‘Nocturnes are fast, don’t hesitate,’ Arnaud said, gesturing. He could barely discern his own voice. Bernie nodded again; Arnaud knew he hadn’t heard a word, but it didn’t matter. All Night Officers were required to know how to read lips and sign language.
	
    Arnaud turned and entered the Sinclair station.
	
    There were two bodies on the waxed floors of the station. Arnaud kept his Colt pistol raised as he stooped and turned them over; they wore white shirts and black slacks like him and Bernie. He didn’t need to check their pulses to tell that they were dead. Fauborg wasn’t a large district, and he recognised the two Night Officers; Garrett Fitzgerald and Gill Faber. Fitzgerald’s throat had been ripped out. Faber had three bullet wounds in his chest; his throat remained intact. Arnaud glanced over his shoulder; Bernie was staring at Fitzgerald. Arnaud turned. There were four shell casings on the ground and streaks of ash that led to the backdoor of the station.
	
    They nabbed one at least.
	
    Arnaud cautiously stepped forward. He leaned over the cashier’s desk. Another man lay crumpled behind it; his throat had also been gouged out. Arnaud presumed it was his blood that had been painted across the wall. The backdoor behind the till was open; it led onto an alleyway. 
	
    As he approached the door, he stepped on something soft. He glanced down and frowned, but kept moving. 
    
    He poked his head into the alleyway. A chain-link fence ran close to the wall – chicken wire gates blocked both sides. To his left, away from the river and towards town, he saw a dark shape trembling against the gate. Arnaud raised his hand, gesturing towards Bernie. He stepped into the alleyway.
	
    The nocturnus had been caught in the chicken wire of the gate; it had evidently tried to climb over but had been too weak. Its right leg had been blown away just beneath the femur; Fitzgerald’s or Faber’s silver bullet must have struck through its calf, cindering the dead flesh and bone. The creature lay on its back as its stump was caught between the gaps in the wire. Arnaud, weary, stopped a few yards from it. Bernie stepped in beside him.
	
    Arnaud had seen nocturnes before, but he would never become accustomed to the sight of them.
	
    Nocturnes were, for all intents and purposes, human in appearance. They walked like humans, could eat like humans, could even talk and love and hate like humans. But once they had begun to feed, there was nothing else that they resembled less.
	
    The nocturnus breathed heavily as it looked up at them, though it had no eyes. A veil of skin was stretched taut over its skull like a mask. It had no nose save for twin slits embedded in the centre of its face, no ears save for two gaping holes in the side of its head. Its mouth, pulled into a perpetual grin, was filled with metallic needles. Bloodstained lips pulled back over the teeth as it spoke quickly.
	
    ‘Officers, please free me from this predicament, then put the barrels of those guns in your mouths and pull the triggers. Be so kind as to do that for me, pretty please.’
	
    Though the nocturnus’s face was upside down to Arnaud as it lay on its back, he could still read its lips.
	
    Arnaud glanced at the thing’s stump. Blood ebbed from it, and ash sloughed from the fringes of the immolated flesh. He turned his body to Bernie, but he didn’t dare take his eyes off the trapped creature.
	
    ‘Not a threat. Will die soon. Put it out of its misery.’
	
    He saw Bernie’s nervous response out of the corner of his eye.
	
    ‘You do it.’
	
    Arnaud sighed. He raised his Colt and pulled the hammer back. The nocturnus flinched at the sound.
	
    Arnaud, about to pull the trigger, stopped and blinked. He wasn’t in New Orleans anymore.
	
    He stood in front of a blazing village in a tropical clime, the buzzing of mosquitoes and carrion flies and tinnitus ringing in his ears. The ringing almost drowned out the din of the screams. To his right was a great mound of freshly rent earth, its soil light as they had not dug too deeply. To his left, an assembled platoon of emerald conquerors in flak jackets. Before him, the shallow pit, a home for the conquered. He held a rifle in hands that trembled.
	
    A dark-haired girl with beetle-black eyes, no older than ten, stared at him. Her face was covered in soot. She didn’t cry. As far as Arnaud could tell, she was the only one not to.
	
    The order was given, and the village echoed with a chorus of gunshots. The girl flinched. But he did not fire his rifle. He couldn’t. The sergeant didn’t say a word as he disposed of the girl, the girl who fell into the shallow mound and did not rise again. The sergeant spoke softly into his ear.
	
    ‘You do it, or next time you’re on roach duty.’
	
    In Fauborg, the Colt felt heavy in his hand. He turned to Bernie.
	
    ‘You do it.’ He didn’t care if his lips had been read. He rushed past Bernie and into the store and out the front and flung the door of the Fairlane open.
	
    He ripped the cotton out of his ears and clawed at his throat, tried to suck breath into his lungs. As police sirens began to echo down Chartres Street, he heard the blast of a shotgun in the still night air. He lay in the seat, panting for God knew how long. He had no crucifix, no icon to kiss or to plead with.
	
    His breath came in shallow bouts, and he thought he was going to suffocate.
	
    Then, from the dark, dark depths of his mind, an image. It cast water-dappled reflections on the darkness, pushed it back, expanded and became the centre of his attention.
	
    The bay of Saigon on that sunny day.
	
    His breathing slowly eased. He inhaled deeply several times, felt his lungs expand until it felt they would burst, exhaled. No sooner had it passed was he stepping out of the Fairlane.
	
    He found Bernie walking listlessly about the back of the store. He held the shotgun limply in one hand. Leaning against the door of a soda fridge, he doubled over and threw up. Arnaud ignored him and walked towards the backdoor entrance. He crouched and scooped up the soft material he had stepped on earlier; he shoved it into his pocket.
	
    ‘It’s easier if you occupy your mind,’ Arnaud said over his shoulder. ‘Puzzles are usually good, for a time. Unfortunately, the only puzzle we have here is this bloody mess. Bernie, tell me what happened here.’ Arnaud could deduce for himself what had occurred.
	
    Bernie turned. A length of vomit stretched over his chin and his hands shook, but he indulged Arnaud.
	
    ‘Fitz and Faber came to fill up the tank, like us. They entered the station, and from where their bodies are, I’d imagine they were waiting in the queue; they’re too far back from the till to have been paying. Maybe there was one more person in front of them. Maybe the nocturnus was in front of them.’
	
    ‘What then? Why would the nocturnus reveal himself here, in front of two officers?’
	
    Bernie frowned and he sweated and he thought. ‘It was in the middle of using the Magic Word on the cashier?’
	
    ‘It was using the Magic Word on someone, yes, I believe so.’
	
    ‘So, the nocturnus maybe wanted to bring the cashier somewhere else to induct him. Maybe Fitz and Faber came in and saw what was going on and drew their silver, so the nocturnus killed the cashier and … and the officers.’
	
    The sirens grew louder in the street outside. Arnaud paid no mind.
	
    ‘There was a second nocturnus,’ Arnaud said.
	
    Bernie looked at him with wide eyes. ‘There was?’
	
    Arnaud nodded. ‘Faber didn’t have his throat torn out, he was shot. Why?’
	
    The thought came slowly to Bernie. ‘Faber’s deaf.’ 
    
    ‘Nocturnes are fast, but they’re not that fast. The one in the alleyway, say it was the one using the Magic Word on the cashier when Fitz and Faber came in. It wouldn’t have had the time to react, to kill the cashier and then turn to use the Magic Word on Fitz. 
    
    ‘There was a second nocturnus here; it told Fitz to shoot Faber, then killed Fitz while the other one got rid of the tiller.’
	
    ‘Who shot the nocturnus in the alleyway then?’
	
    ‘Check their Colts; I reckon there are three rounds missing from Fitz’s Colt and one from Faber’s. I reckon Faber got a shot off before he died from the gunshots. Clipped our friend in the alleyway.’
	
    Bernie complied and checked the chambers of the Night Officers’ Colts. He looked up at Arnaud and nodded. ‘So, the second nocturnus got away.’
	
    ‘I believe so,’ Arnaud said as the door of the gas station opened. A quartet of Fauborg Night Officers slowly stepped into the gas station, their faces drawn and gaunt as they looked upon their fallen comrades. Arnaud offered a hand to Bernie and hauled him to his feet.
	
    ‘Tu as fait bien, mon ami.’


    
    Later that morning, Arnaud sat in his dark apartment. He had never furnished it, not even with a bed. He sat with his back to the wall, and thought. He had the blinds drawn. Like the thing he hunted, he had grown uncomfortable with the glare of the sun.
	
    He twirled a piece of torn cloth in his hand; the material he had stepped on in the gas station. It hadn’t taken much detective skill to discern what it was. It was a ragged strip torn from a white uniform, pristine white save for a few fine droplets of blood. 
    
    There was a name stitched in red thread on the cloth.
    
    He stared at the name.
    
    Antoinette the stitching read.
	
    Though he had no furnishings in the apartment, he did have a telephone. It sat beside him. He picked up the handle and dialled in. He waited and waited as the phone rang out. He dialled again and waited. No answer. He tried a final time, and on the third blare of the bells a voice answered.
	
    ‘Hullo?’ The voice came as a croak, recently roused from the depths of sleep.
	
    ‘Hey, Tony. It’s Arnaud.’
	
    A pleased sigh. ‘I was having such pleasant dreams before you interrupted them. What seems to be the officer, problem?’
	
    ‘I’m sorry to say this, but we’ll have to reschedule our trip to the cinema. Something came up at work and it’s time sensitive. I’m sorry, but it’s out of my hands.’
	
    ‘That’s okay, Arnaud.’ He heard no reproach in her voice. ‘Can reschedule for Sunday, does that work?’
	
    ‘Yeah, I can get up before work.’
	
    ‘You sure?’
	
    ‘I am.’
	
    ‘Will I see you tonight?’
	
    ‘I believe you will.’
	
    She yawned. ‘Neato. I’m going back to sleep. If you call me again during the day you can consider this scandalous affair done. See you later.’
	
    ‘See you later, Tony,’ he said, and hung up the phone.

    He parked in front of Gill Faber’s house. The street outside was clogged with cars, friends and family and acquaintances who had come to grieve and deliver their condolences. Arnaud had come for no such thing. Bernie, unusually quiet, climbed out of the car behind him and followed.
	
    He sidled his way up the steps to the front door, murmuring his apologies to the sweating funeral party that languished in the heat of the day. Several dozen people, dressed in sweating black, had gathered outside the Faber home. Even before he had stepped out of the Fairlane, he had heard the caterwauls of despair pouring from the house. He held his Night Officer’s hat in his hands as he stepped into the front hallway of the Faber’s. Several of his colleagues milled about awkwardly, shoulder to shoulder, clutching cool glasses of lemonade with sweating hands. They nodded at Arnaud.
	
    Arnaud spoke to them quickly and quietly. None had the answers he sought.
	
    ‘Where’s Mr Faber?’ Arnaud asked them.
	
    In unison, they nodded in the direction of the kitchen which rested at the end of a brightly lit corridor.
	
    ‘Is he in any state to speak?’
	
    One of the officers shrugged. ‘As good as any of them.’
	
    Arnaud grunted and moved past them. Bernie remained behind with the officers, though none of them attempted any conversation. Under the cries of despair was the low murmuring of the gathered cherished, those who had known Gill the best. With no coffin to safeguard, as the body was still in the morgue, the mourners stood in circlets and revolved slowly as newcomers pushed into the house, revolving orbitals of black cloth that choked the arteries of the house.
	
    Arnaud, when he made it to the kitchen, was surprised to find that it was empty. Mostly empty. It was a small kitchenette, cloying but colourful, well-worn. A man in a white shirt and faded jeans was cutting loaves of bread at the counter. Arnaud coughed. The man turned. In his eyes Arnaud saw a vast and complete desolation he had seen many times before, a sweeping emptiness that he knew too well.
	
    ‘Mr Faber, my condolences,’ Arnaud said stiffly. He had never been good at funerals. ‘My name is Arnaud. I worked with your son.’
	
    Mr Faber smiled, though no warmth nor despair reached his eyes. He turned back to cutting the loaves. A large pile of crookedly cut bread grew larger as he worked. Arnaud ploughed on.
	
    ‘Mr Faber, I was wondering if you had seen Gill’s girlfriend. I would like to—’
	
    ‘Netty isn’t here,’ Mr Faber said. There was more than a hint of venom in his voice.
	
    ‘Where is she?’
	
    ‘She’s not here. She didn’t bother to come.’
	
    ‘I see. Perhaps she was delayed in getting here. It’s early in the day, and you know how difficult it can be to cross the city during the morning rush.’
	
    Mr Faber turned and looked at Arnaud thoughtfully. ‘Yes, maybe that’s the case … maybe she’s just delayed. Maybe Gill is with her. He’d often stay the night at hers, though I always told him that it wasn’t proper, not until they got married. When will that boy ever learn.’ Mr Faber laughed and shook his head. He waved his hand. ‘Yes, you’re right, Gill must be with Netty. I don’t know what all of this nonsense is about. Some prank. Yes.’
	
    Arnaud didn’t bother trying to dissuade the old man. ‘Perhaps I could collect Netty. I have the car parked outside. A short trip and we’ll be back.’
	
    Mr Faber’s face lit up. ‘That’s a swell idea! And you can bring Gill too. You tell him he’s in for it when he gets back, you hear?’
	
    ‘Yes, sir. Where does Netty live?’
	
    ‘On the far side of English Turn. You better get a move on, before the traffic!’
	
    Arnaud paused. ‘Where does Netty work?’
	
    ‘Eh?’
	
    Arnaud repeated the question, though he could tell he’d already lost Mr Faber’s attention. The old man turned back to the hacked loaf.
	
    ‘Some hospital in Meraux. I don’t know.’
	
    Arnaud muttered a departure and left.


‘How many hospitals can there be left to check?’ Bernie said, his usual bombast subdued. 

It was late evening, and the roads were packed with those beating the clock to dusk. Arnaud drummed his fingers along the steering wheel as he waited before a red light that was sluggish in the turning. Horns blared along the Meraux street, and many hurried along the sidewalk. He glanced at his watch.

‘There aren’t that many,’ he said. There was no concern in his voice, though he felt that sweating dread running down his spine. They had left the Faber household early in the morning and had gone straight to Netty’s apartment; its interior had looked as if a rabid wildcat had rampaged through it. The bed had been torn to shreds, the furniture overturned and the upholstery gutted. One of the windows had been smashed completely. There was no rhyme or reason to the carnage, a carnage Arnaud had seen in the apartments of singletons in Lafayette before. He had had no doubt that Netty had succumbed to the curse of the nocturnus; however, the destroyed apartment had convinced Bernie of Arnaud’s deduction.

Bernie had admonished him for keeping the tag ripped from Netty’s uniform.

‘Why didn’t you tell the rest of the Night Officers about the nurse’s tag? You’re going to be fucking suspended and tried for obstruction.’

Arnaud hadn’t Bernie he had kept it as he had feared, before reason had set in, that the tag belonged to another Antoinette.

‘She works at one of the hospitals,’ Arnaud had said as they tore away from Netty’s apartment. ‘Do you ever remember Gill saying which one?’

Bernie had shaken his head. ‘I never watched Gill sign, it was too boring. Are you sure the hospital was in Meraux? We could ask someone at the station if they knew which one she worked in?’

‘There aren’t that many hospitals in Meraux. No time to go to the station. Need to look ourselves before the sun goes down. She’s going to waltz straight into whatever hospital she works in once the lights go out and she’s going to infect God knows how many.’

Arnaud glanced in the rear view mirror. They were heading east, and the sun had long disappeared behind the high-style Queen Anne’s in the west.

‘Fuck,’ he said to himself as the photovoltaics on the street burst into life. Those who remained on the sidewalks scrambled, running in the direction of their homes. They’d all heard the news of the attack at Sinclair.

He parked the Fairlane on the curb outside of a dishevelled butchers. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he thought. Augustus Hospital. St.Lucienne’s. County Health. Charity Hospital. Those were the Meraux hospitals they had visited during the day, and none had employed Netty. Arnaud knew in his bones that after Netty had transmuted into a nocturnus, she had broken through the window of her apartment to find somewhere secluded, somewhere to stay safe during the day. As the curse wore on, many nocturnes would find sanctum in the sewers of whatever city they infested, or took root in abandoned refuses out in the swamp. Didn’t need an invite for places like those.

Nocturnes was cunning, and he surmised that Netty had left the safety of her apartment for a reason. He knew that she had been targeted in Sinclair for a reason. He knew the reasons were there, but he couldn’t discern what they were.
	
‘Think, Bernie,’ he said. ‘You spoke to Gill in the bar after work. Did he say anything about Netty recently? Anything at all about where she works?’
	
Bernie bit the knuckles on his fist as he thought. Arnaud could hear the gears turning in his head.
	
‘He said she was pregnant,’ Bernie said after a moment, signing what Gill had said as he did so. He cradled his hands to his stomach and rocked them back and forth. Arnaud stared at Bernie as he continued. ‘Yes, he said she was pregnant. Maybe she’s gone to the hospital where she got her check-up?’

‘Do that sign again.’

‘What?’

‘Gill said she was pregnant, do the sign again.’

Bernie did as told, cradling his hands to his stomach.

‘That’s not the sign for ‘pregnant’, that’s the sign for ‘baby’,’ Arnaud said, thinking.

‘So what?’

‘Well, St.John’s has the biggest maternity ward, but that’s not in Meraux, it’s in Lakeview and …’ He then realised his mistake. ‘Hoskins.’

‘Hoskins?’

Arnaud released the handbrake and pressed down on the throttle. ‘She didn’t work in a hospital. She worked in Hoskins Maternity Ward.’

Arnaud remained silent as Bernie bombarded him with questions. He didn’t answer until they were halfway across Meraux, near the northern loop of the Mississippi.

Finally, he answered Bernie.

‘Remember I told you about that maternity ward burning down in Baton Rouge? I didn’t make much of it – the Night Officer HQ didn’t make a fuss, and no one was hurt. It was mostly empty at the time when those fucking amateurs used flammables to burn it down. But you know what I think? I think that there was a nocturnus there that night.’

He glanced at Bernie, his eyes wide and manic.

‘Netty was in Sinclair last night with Fitz and Faber. Why would a couple of nocturnes attack Netty in the Sinclair station, right in front of two Night Officers? They’re not stupid. Why kill Fitz and Faber and the cashier in a public place, when they could have so easily cajoled their way into a lonely house on the edge of town? Why take Netty and kill the rest?’

Bernie shook his head wildly.

‘The fucking maternity ward, Bernadotte!’ Arnaud hissed. ‘Whatever about the nurses and the physicians in there, if Netty and that other nocturnus were to … Jesus, if they were to …’

Beside him, Bernie’s eyes widened. ‘Christ Almighty.’

They didn’t speak until they pulled up to Hoskins. The old, wooden building, a sagging remnant that had been built before Napoleon had sold the state, sat on the peripheries of the sprawl of New Orleans. Its wide porch sported cracked beams that held up a warped veranda, and the slats buckled at its sides like a sagging gut. But still it had withstood the test of time, and still its lights were on. As the Fairlane juddered to a halt in front of Hoskins, Arnaud could see that the front door was open. A nurse in a white uniform, quite bloodied, lay prostrate in the doorway.

Arnaud leapt out of the car, his Colt in hand. Bernie called after him, but he didn’t wait. He glanced at the dead nurse as he stepped over her; two chunks of flesh had been ripped out on both sides of her throat. Sweating, he raised his Colt and entered the ward.

There was no crying of babes, no gentle murmur of tired nurses, no soft laugh of flirting physicians. There was no sound at all, even as he stepped upon the centuries old floorboards. At the reception desk, a physician in black slacks and white lab coat lay face first against the wall; his back had been broken. Beyond the desk was a stair that turned upon itself. He peered into the open doorways on either side as he moved; they were just surgeries, empty and dark.

He passed the desk and the broken doctor and began his ascent.

As he turned with the curve of the stair, he saw Netty crouched on the landing of the second floor. 

She looked up at him, her face an executioner’s veil spattered with blood. She hovered over another dead nurse. She still wore her uniform with the missing name tag.

He raised his Colt.

‘Stop.’

He hadn’t stuffed his ears with cotton.

He stopped.

Her voice was sweetened oil poured into his ear. He had never heard anything so dark and terrible and beautiful. Even Tony’s voice, the timbre of her laugh, even they couldn’t compare.

‘Come to me.’

He came to her. Slowly he trudged up the stair, blissfully aware of the doom to which he went. She wiped the blood from her mouth and smiled, the teeth glinting under the glare of the fluorescent lamps above. She stepped back as he stepped forward, her movements that of water transmuted to flesh and bone, a pale ballerina doused in blood. His heart did not pound, and he did not sweat.

‘Kneel.’

He knelt, and she came to him.

He could smell the coppered stench of blood on her mouth as she crawled towards him. She stopped, inches away from his face. She cocked her head, considering him.

‘You have a pretty face. I don’t want to get blood on it. Hold out your wrist.’

He held out his wrist.

Slowly, she undid the buttons of his cuff. Her touch aroused him. She pulled back the sleeve.

‘Enjoy.’

She threw her head back, her needled teeth bared, and bit down on his wrist.

He gasped sharply as she clamped her jaws around his arm, but not from pain; the sensation of her silvered teeth plunging into his flesh was exquisite, and in that moment, he wanted her to drain every ounce of blood that coursed through his body.

The moment did not last long.

He didn’t hear the gunshot, but Netty’s head exploded nonetheless as a silver bullet burst through her skull. Her head disappeared in a cloud of ash and blood as she fell back from Arnaud, her body draped over the dead nurse. She did not scream nor did she writhe, dead before she’d hit the floor.

‘Arnaud … Jesus, Arnaud …’

Bernie stood beside him, the Colt smoking in his hand. He stared with wide eyes at Arnaud’s arm. A semi-circlet of pinpricks, already blackening, dotted his arm where Netty had begun to feed. There was no pain that Arnaud could sense as he climbed to his feet; he regarded the wound. It did not bleed. He felt a faint tingling, pleasurable, shooting up his arm in pulses.

So that’s it, he thought as he rolled the cuff of his sleeve back down to the wrist. His mind was desolate; there was no despair that rolled like a thundering wave, no histrionics to drown him on what would be his last night. So that’s it.

‘I guess she got me,’ he said, turning to Bernie.

Bernie stared at him, the Colt dangling loosely in his hand. Arnaud reached out and grasped Bernie by the shoulder. ‘We’ve a job to finish, Bernadotte.’

Just as he spoke, a cry echoed from one of the dark rooms of the second floor, and that cry did move Arnaud. It turned his heart to ice, and he felt then that perhaps his constitution would fail. 

The cry that echoed through the maternity ward was that of a babe awoken in the night by an unwelcome visitor, awoken by a shadow that had entered the Garden of Eden to pluck the apple and taint it, an apple that would in turn taint those possessed of good hearts, taint those who would hear a crying child alone in the night and willingly bring it into their homes, a dark child invited that would sow the curse of the unliving amongst those who would be charitable.

Arnaud did not hesitate.

He hurried to the room from where the cry emanated. Though the lights were not on, he found he could see perfectly in the dark; his arm throbbed. Three rows of white cribs were arranged in the room, sanctums for thirty babies. Even in the gloom, he could see the dots of blood that stained the cribs.

When I see the blood, I will pass over you and will not harm you when I punish the Egyptians. But these bloodstains had not acted as the wards of God, had not protected these children. No, they were a dark mirror of the Lord’s sigil, the markings of an infernal thing that had come to deliver the wants of some dark master of the pit.


The nocturnus stood at the end of the room, a babe clutched in its arms. It raised its head as Arnaud stood on the threshold of the room. Its lips were smeared with blood. The baby had stopped crying, and he could see the bite mark on the doughy flesh of its arm. The nocturnus grinned as it looked upon him.

‘Officer, raise that pistol and—’

Arnaud raised the pistol and fired twice.

A miasma of smouldering ash and blood erupted from the nocturnus’s torso as the silver bullets tore through it, punching bloody and burning craters in its chest. It fell back without a sound, the child in its arms silent as it was released from its grip, silent as it thudded on the floor.

His Colt still raised, Arnaud stood motionless. The gunshots rang in his ears, the smell of gunpowder and burning flesh redolent in the nursery. Slowly did he lower the pistol and slowly did he venture deeper into the room, peering into each crib that he passed.

The infants in the cribs, deathly quiet, deathly pale, watched him as he walked by. All of their eyes were open, and in their gaze he saw a ferocious and dark intelligence that regarded him with equal interest. These were not the eyes of children, but the eyes of nocturnus, eyes to him that seemed to glint in the darkness like silver dollars under the sheen of moonlight.

Tears flowed freely as he walked through this tomb of the new-borns, as he saw that he had been too late. Each and every crib had been marked with a bloodstain, blood that had fallen from the lips of the nocturnus as it had inducted these new children of the damned.

He crouched by the baby that the nocturnus had dropped. It lay on its face, its arms and legs askew. He turned it over. Its eyes were open, and it regarded him with a cold malice. He screwed his eyes shut against that gaze, fearful that it would prevent him from committing the necessary.

‘Arnaud?’

Bernie stood in the doorway of the nursery. He flicked the light switch on the wall and plunged the nursery into crackling fluorescence. In unison, the babies began to cry, their newly enhanced eyesight unaccustomed to the glare of the lights. Bernie’s mouth fell open as he spied the bloody markings of the cribs.

‘Turn it off, Bernie.’

Bernie turned the lights off, and Arnaud went to him.

Bernie took a step back as Arnaud emerged from the shadows of the nursery. Arnaud, though he knew it would take a few hours for the nocturnus curse to fully take hold, found that he was staring at Bernie’s neck. He felt the desire to break the skin of that stubbled nape, to drink from its font and taste the warmth of the ambrosia that would pour forth. He suppressed the urge.

‘Bring me the nitrate,’ Arnaud said.

Bernie’s face paled, but he did not argue. He left Arnaud, and returned some minutes later, grunting as he carried a cumbersome load up the stairs; it was a compressed tank of silver nitrate. Attached to the tank were two arm straps and a long, thin tube. At the end of the tube was the delivery system, a black iron frame with a conical nozzle at its fore and a trigger at its base. Arnaud took the nitrate and slipped his arms through the straps; the tank was heavy on his back. He held the nozzle and trigger handle tightly in his hands.

‘What are you going to do?’ Bernie asked quietly, though he knew the answer. Arnaud ignored him.

‘Bernie, I want you to leave this place. Go to the station and tell them what happened here. Tell them that nocturnes may be targeting maternity wards and hospitals. Tell them that they’re using children to spread the curse, or that they may do so in the future. Go and tell them this.’

‘Where will you go after … after the …’

Arnaud held the nozzle aloft and tested the trigger of the nitrate. A pressurised stream of clear liquid shot from the contraption, spattering the ceiling. He made sure not to get any on himself. ‘What time is it?’

Bernie glanced at his watch. ‘It’s 10.34.’

Arnaud nodded. ‘After I leave here, I’m going to go for a walk. I don’t think I’ll be tired; I think I’ll stay awake to see the sunrise. It’s been a while since I’ve seen one.’

Bernie made an odd sound, a dry clacking of the throat. Arnaud hoisted the nitrate tank on his back and stepped to the threshold of the nursery.

‘Go away, Bernie. You don’t want to see this. You don’t want to hear this.’

Bernie remained motionless. ‘What are you going to do?’ he asked again, his voice laboured.

‘Roach duty.’

Arnaud stepped forward and slammed the door of the nursery shut behind him.

It was utterly silent in the room. There was no movement that he could see; he imagined that the babies sensed danger, sensed that their deliverer stood in the room with them. If they did sense it, they were not wrong.

He raised the nozzle, his finger hovering over the trigger. Sweat trickled down his face. The scent of blood and burning flesh filled his nostrils, but there was something else he could smell now; though he must have imagined it, the aroma of old petroleum swam underneath the odour of the room, an oily layer of chemical stench that he had known before. His ears rang from the silence that engulfed him, engulfed the children, engulfed the world. That silence rang and rang and rang and reached such staggering pitches that he thought that his eardrums would burst. As he stood there, motionless, the ringing silence alchemised, transmuted into a coda he had heard before, a coda composed by the choir of the dying in a land far from home, a land he and his had fallen upon with a scythe of steel and flame. The silence became a lament of screams, and he soaked in it, witnessed it again, bore it until he could bear it no more.

He pulled the trigger, and the silver nitrate burst forth.

Where the nitrate connected with the flesh of the babes, it blossomed into a gout of silvered and azured flame. The first infant to be doused screamed its little lungs ragged as it was immolated, consumed by a fire not wrought by any prophet nor god, but a fire manufactured in the chemical plants of Lafayette. The first was followed by many more, and all met the same fate. Arnaud turned on his hips, spewing the liquid into each crib. His dead eyes reflected the spurts of flame that flared from the cribs, his ears rang with the din of tiny shrieks. Yet he did not stop. Doughy flesh withered and constricted and cracked as the silver slithered and poured into the pores of the infants, as it purged whatever evil had entered their veins. Some of the nitrate entered their mouths or their noses, took root in the depths of their heads and eructed from their eye sockets, and their visages were reduced to those of the cherub with the grinning skull. He poured the liquid silver into each crib, into each tiny abode. He did this as he had done it before in a strange land with strange people in a time bygone. And as he did it, he wept, wept as he had before.

In the end, the nursery danced with the light of the moon, silver flames that crackled and swayed from the cribs like ghosts chained to their crypts.

In the end, there were no more screams that rang through his head, no scent of the orange nor silver flame, nor the scent of scorched flesh.

In the end, he felt nothing, for he was nothing.

He sat by the stream in Crescent Park.

He was alone, and the moon hung in the sky, peering down at him curiously from the clouds. Crickets sang around him. The willows whispered. The wind sighed. Dawn was not far off.

He had walked from Hoskins Maternity Ward in a daze, with no destination in mind. He had simply allowed his feet to lead him into the night. The throbbing in his arm, where Netty had bitten him, had stopped long ago. He couldn’t feel his hands nor his face. The only sensation to have visited him on his long walk was a growing pit of hunger in his stomach.

He had been surprised when he arrived at the front door of his apartment. He hadn’t remembered getting there. He thought he’d fumbled the lock, thrown the door open and slammed it shut behind him. A mindless rage had visited upon him then, the urge to destroy and gouge and rip and tear. This urge he resisted.

A clarifying thought had cut through his fugue, the prow of the ship that cut through murky waters. He had had little in his apartment in New Orleans, for there was little that he deserved, but he’d had what he needed.

By the stream in Crescent Park, a sealed envelope lay beside him. It did not bulge, and it was not heavy, yet all the same it brimmed with the content of his heart. He had thought about bringing it to Gauche’s, to see her one last time, to hear her laugh and see her smile one last time. He did not do this, as he had been fearful of what he might have done to her.

He glanced up at the sky. The first hint of light had crept in from the east. He watched it as the minutes passed, as it seeped and sundered the clouds that veiled the moon. In his hand he held a monochrome photo of a pretty girl with bright eyes. He waited.
	He glanced at the letter beside him. He did not feel the urge to re-read it, as he knew its content by heart, as its content had been borne by his heart for over twenty years:

Tony,
I love you.
I have loved you since the first day I laid eyes upon you.
I have loved you since I watched you smash an ice-cream over Julie Matherson’s head in Barracuda Street because she didn’t laugh at your pig in the hat joke.
I have loved you since the night you sang The Wise Old Owl at the school play. You tripped over the stand and fell off the stage. You broke Julie Matherson’s tuba (she should have avoided you after the ice-cream incident).
I have loved you since you spent an entire evening telling me and Louis about the talking wardrobe and the deaf clown in Les Contes du Cosmos. I still don’t understand what you were talking about.
I have loved you since the night you gave me your photo. I had wanted to kiss you, but I had been too afraid. I am still too afraid. Afraid that every time I touched you you’d disappear, or that I’d be whisked away to shores unknown.
I have loved you since my first night in France, where the memory of you kept the rain at bay, where the memory of you kept me warm in the darkest of nights, where the memory of you protected me.

I have loved you since the night I saw you in Gauche’s. You were singing Ben E. King in the diner, I could hear you through the glass (you can’t sing very well, I’m afraid). After that night, I hated that song, because it reminded me of you, reminded me that we never had the chance to live a shared life of contentment and laughter and silly tales from space. Yes, I hated that song, but now it’s not so bad. Now that I’ve known you again, even for the briefest of moments, no, it’s not so bad.

I love you, Tony, and I will always love you.
I hope you find this letter, and I hope one day I find you again.
Arnaud

The birds were singing in the trees. The sun had almost crested the horizon.

He had thought, in his last moments, that he would think of the horrors he had committed: the men he had killed in France, the whites of their eyes like spotlights in their faces as he plunged the bayonet in the trenches; the men he had beaten to within an inch of their life in Marseille for doing the unspeakable; the innocents he had purged from the nameless villages in a waking hell.
	
Instead, as the sunlight bloomed in the sky, he closed his eyes and thought of her. He inhaled through his nose and smelled freshly laundered clothes. He heard not the singing of the birds nor the crickets, but heard the timbre of a gasping laugh.
The sun rose.
By the stream in Crescent Park nothing remained, save for an unopened letter, and a photo of a pretty girl with eyes as bright as the bay of Saigon.
